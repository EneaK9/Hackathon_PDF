      "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n",
      " \n",
      "A commercial security system can be defined as a set of security measures taken to protect a person, \n",
      "community, dwelling, personal belongings, or an organization from any harm in a commercial environment. \n",
      "To avoid such threats in a commercial environment, various security products are used. The demand for \n",
      "security systems has increased because of the requirement to protect individuals and assets from rapidly \n",
      "increasing threats and rising consumer awareness and security concerns and willingness to pay for \n",
      "security systems. Security products including fire protection systems, video surveillance, access control \n",
      "systems, entrance control systems, remote monitoring service, and security system integration service \n",
      "have been covered in the report.  \n",
      "Video surveillance products are expected to dominate the commercial security system market in terms of \n",
      "their market growth rate as well as market size. Video surveillance systems use video cameras to monitor \n",
      "people, facilities, or places from a distance. Video surveillance is an extremely useful and economical \n",
      "method to ensure the security of people, buildings, and valuables. Fire protection systems help prevent fire \n",
      "accidents and, subsequently, the damages caused by them. Such systems also reduce the impact of \n",
      "uncontrolled fires, thus saving lives and property. Fire accidents can be prevented by using fire protection \n",
      "systems such as fire alarms and detection systems, fire sprinkler systems, and fire suppression systems. \n",
      "The demand for fire protection systems has grown considerably in the last decade as most countries are \n",
      "committed to safety regulations. Access control systems consist of authentication systems such as cards \n",
      "and readers, biometric readers, and multi-technology readers. Cards and readers include magnetic stripes, \n",
      "proximity cards, and smart cards. Biometric access control systems include fingerprint readers, hand \n",
      "geometry readers, iris scanners, and facial recognition readers. Electronic locks are also widely used in \n",
      "access control as they provide low-cost automation in entrance systems. \n",
      "Key factors contributing to the growth of the commercial security system market include the rising number \n",
      "of terrorist attacks and organized crimes across the world, growing construction industry, expanding \n",
      "adoption of IP cameras, accelerating implementation of stringent fire protection-related regulations, and \n",
      "rising adoption of IoT-based security systems powered by cloud computing platforms. However, high \n",
      "installation, maintenance, and ownership costs of commercial security systems and major security and \n",
      "privacy concerns are the major challenges to the commercial security system market. Moreover, growing \n",
      "government and stakeholder funding for developing smart cities and employing city surveillance solutions, \n",
      "rising adoption of ACaaS and VSaaS, and increasing periodic revision of fire protection-related regulatory \n",
      "compliances provide new opportunities for the growth of the commercial security system market. On the \n",
      "other hand, cybersecurity-related threats and integration of user interfaces with fire protection systems are \n",
      "a few key challenges for the market’s growth.  \n",

      "Dry \n",
      "Dry fire sprinklers have been specifically designed for areas where sprinklers may be subjected to freezing \n",
      "conditions. Such conditions are witnessed in buildings/structures in which the pipes may be exposed to \n",
      "temperatures below 40° F and are thus likely to freeze. In this system, pipes are filled with pressurized air \n",
      "or nitrogen rather than water. A remote, dry pipe valve is held by the pressurized air in a closed position. \n",
      "Located in a heated space, dry pipe valves prevent water from entering the pipe until a fire causes one or \n",
      "more sprinklers to operate. This causes the air to escape from the pipe that releases the dry pipe valve. \n",
      "Water then enters the pipe, flowing through open sprinklers onto the fire. \n",
      "Advantages of dry pipe sprinkler systems \n",
      "Use in cold spaces: Dry pipe sprinkler systems provide automatic protection in cold spaces where freezing \n",
      "is possible. Such systems are typically installed in unheated warehouses and attics, exterior loading docks, \n",
      "and commercial freezers. \n",
      "Disadvantages of dry pipe sprinkler systems \n",
      " \n",
      "Complexity: Dry pipes require additional control equipment and air pressure supply \n",
      "components, which increase the complexity of the system. If not maintained properly, this \n",
      "equipment may be less reliable compared with a wet pipe system. \n",
      " \n",
      "High installation and maintenance costs: Increased complexity leads to an increase in the \n",
      "overall dry pipe installation cost. It also increases the maintenance expenditure of the system, \n",
      "primarily due to added service labor costs. \n",
      " \n",
      "Limited design flexibility: Dry pipe systems have limitations regarding the permitted size \n",
      "(typically 750 gallons). This limits flexibility while designing dry pipe sprinkler systems. \n",
      " \n",
      "Delay in fire response: In dry pipe sprinkler systems, the time duration between the opening of \n",
      "sprinkler and discharge of water onto fire may be up to 60 seconds. This delay in fire \n",
      "extinguishing actions may result in increased damage. \n",
      " \n",
      "Increased potential for corrosion: Dry pipe sprinkler systems must be kept completely drained \n",

      "Advantages of pre-action sprinkler systems \n",
      " \n",
      "Less risk of inadvertent discharge: The pre-action valve must operate, and sprinkler heads must \n",
      "fuse to initiate pre-action fire sprinklers. This feature reduces the risk of an accidental \n",

      "between readers and software through various types of communication interfaces, including Wiegand, \n",
      "RS232, RS 485, and TCP/IP. The controller receives the credentials from the reader and compares them \n",

After \\nconfirmation from primary interviews with industry experts, the total revenue has been estimated by \\nreferring to annual reports, SEC filings, paid databases, and MnM Knowledge Store. These companies’ \\nrevenues pertaining to the business units (BUs) and product portfolios that offer commercial security \\nsystems have been identified through similar sources. Then, through primaries, the data of revenue \\ngenerated through specific commercial security systems has been calculated. The collective revenue of key \\ncompanies that offer commercial security systems has been again confirmed through primary interviews \\nwith industry experts. With the assumption that the rest of the market is contributed by smaller players \\n(part of the unorganized market), the market share of organized players (80–90%) and unorganized \\nplayers (10–20%) collectively has been assumed to be the market size of the global commercial security \\nsystem market for FY 2020.  \\nIn the above figure, an illustration of how revenues for individual companies are collated has been \\ndepicted.

This, in turn, will urge infrastructure financing toward consumer sectors, \\nincluding manufacturing and transportation, which facilitate the production and distribution of raw \\nmaterials for consumer goods. Growth in new and retrofit infrastructure has heavily boosted the \\n \\n49 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\nconstruction industry in developing countries. With new development plans and projects, the use of \\nconstruction equipment is also growing. In the construction industry, there have been tremendous \\nadvancements in facility management in developing countries over the past several years, especially in the \\narea of building automation.  \\nFire protection systems in buildings have become common, as these systems are useful in detecting, \\ncontaining, and extinguishing fires at an early stage. Advanced technologies have been developed for \\ncommunicating during fires, which enables quick deployment of response teams to the affected site. For \\nexample, Terma offers T.react Radio Dispatch. This solution works on the TETRA communication \\ninfrastructure for safe communication. It enables security staff to handle all voice-based communications \\non the TETRA network during crises as well as daily operations. \\n5.2.1.3 \\nExpanding adoption of IP cameras  \\nAn Internet Protocol (IP) camera is a networked digital video camera that sends signals to the main server \\nor computer screen through the internet or a network link. An IP camera can be easily installed and, using \\na single coaxial cable for each camera, connected to the existing data network, with minimal effort. Due to \\ntheir high resolution, IP cameras can provide high quality and extremely detailed images. They also support \\ntwo-way communication and can send customized alerts if any suspicious activity occurs. IP cameras are \\nfaster and more reliable than analog closed-circuit cameras and can be accessed from any location. Low-\\ncost storage options, for example, hosted video, make IP cameras more affordable. IP cameras are, \\ntherefore, widely replacing analog cameras owing to their remote surveillance option and digital zoom \\nfeature. IP cameras find applications in commercial, institutional, government, corporate, and defense \\nsectors, among many others.  \\nThe increased adoption of IP cameras has consequently led to a significant reduction in their prices. The \\naverage selling price (ASP) of IP cameras has constantly been declining over the past 5 years. In some \\ncases, IP megapixel cameras can be further cost-effective as the installation expenses are minimized by \\ncontrolling the existing Ethernet ports. Despite the falling prices, high-definition IP cameras bring \\nsignificantly improved capabilities. Thus, better functionalities ranging from basic to advanced analytics, \\nimproved performance, and increased features, all available at a reduced cost, have led to the growing \\ndemand for IP-based cameras for the video surveillance application. The need for highly efficient, time-\\nsaving surveillance systems at affordable costs fuels the growth of the market for video surveillance \\nsolutions. \\n5.2.1.4 \\nAccelerating implementation of stringent fire protection -related \\nregulations \\nFire protection involves the combined efforts of federal custodians, tenants, private sector building owners, \\nand local fire service agencies. Policies and regulations differ from region to region and are meant to \\nsafeguard human life and property. For instance, the Australian Building Codes Board (ABCB) oversees \\nissues related to safety, health, amenity, accessibility, and sustainability in buildings. ABCB is working with \\nFire and Rescue New South Wales (FRNSW), the Australasian Fire and Emergency Services Authorities \\nCouncil (AFAC), and the Fire Protection Association of Australia (FPAA) to extend the current deemed-to-\\nsatisfy (DtS) provisions for sprinkler protection to medium-rise multistory buildings. The Korean Fire \\nProtection Association was established in 2011 as an outcome of the fire prevention law—the Act on the \\nIndemnification for Fire-caused Loss and the Purchase of Insurance Policies. This association provides fire \\nsafety inspection and consulting services to specific buildings, such as manufacturing facilities, \\neducational institutions, schools, and public properties. The governments of most developed economies \\nprovide monetary support for the installation and maintenance of fire protection systems, e.g., smoke \\ndetectors, in commercial buildings.  \\nThe European norm DIN 14676 states that smoke detectors must be installed in bedrooms, children’s \\nrooms, and hallways (escape routes). They must also be installed in all living and hobby rooms, heating \\nand workspaces, as well as the basement. Some codes and standards set by NFPA—such as NFPA 80 \\n \\n50 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n(standard for fire doors and other opening protectives) and NFPA 220 (standard on the type of building \\nconstruction)—are made to deal with construction rules related to insurance and building codes. Because \\nof the increase in fire hazards, government agencies worldwide are implementing stringent measures to \\nreduce fire losses. These regulatory compliances not only help increase the awareness and adoption of fire \\nprotection systems but are also expected to impact market growth positively in the coming years. \\n5.2.1.5 \\nRising adoption of IoT-based security systems powered by cloud \\ncomputing platforms \\nIoT has enhanced the quality and efficiency of automation systems by linking smart objects to the internet \\nand allowing them to exchange data securely. Connected security systems communicate with devices \\nthrough the cloud and help monitor key areas remotely. Moreover, IoT-based security systems are safe \\nbecause they are authenticated with passwords to avoid hacking. Many businesses are shifting their \\ntraditional practices to IoT as the technology can be used in numerous solutions, such as smart alarm \\nsystems and smart garage door openers.  \\nIoT is integrated with cloud computing as the data can be stored online (on the cloud) and can be accessed \\nfrom anywhere. With the growing number of cloud platforms, security and privacy concerns in IoT are also \\nincreasing, which is driving the market for new business models, such as Access Control as a Service \\n(ACaaS) and Video Surveillance as a Service (VSaaS). An example of IoT-enabled security system \\ndeployment is the installation of sensor-equipped devices to identify and track real-time data on a wireless \\nnetwork using cloud services. The large-scale adoption of VSaaS, ACaaS, and cloud computing platforms \\nfuels the growth of the global commercial security system market. \\nWith the rapid development of smoke detectors, along with IoT and big data technologies, the concept of \\nsmart smoke detectors has come to the fore, leading to the expansion of the smoke detector market. \\nSmart smoke detectors are programmable and can be easily connected to Wi-Fi networks in commercial \\nspaces. These detectors provide smoke detection alerts and easy control through mobile devices and \\nfacilitate easy monitoring of the battery status. Such devices can send notifications or fire alerts through \\ntext messages or emails and facilitate color-coded alerts in case hearing-impaired people are using the \\ndetectors. This recent shift toward the use of smart smoke detectors is expected to create new \\nopportunities for the smoke detector segment during the forecast period. \\n5.2.2 \\nRESTRAINTS  \\n  FIGURE 21 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET RESTRAINTS AND THEIR IMPACT  \\n \\nSource: Expert Interviews and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n \\n \\nRESTRAINTS\\n2 YEARS\\n5 YEARS\\nREASON\\nHigh installation, \\nmaintenance, and ownership \\ncosts of commercial security \\nsystems\\n\\uf06e\\n\\uf06e\\nHigh costs associated with the installation and maintenance of \\naccess control systems is expected to be the key factor hindering \\nthe growth of the market. \\nMajor security and privacy \\nconcerns\\n\\uf06e\\n\\uf06e\\nGovernments and private sector organizations should take \\nnecessary steps to lower the impact of video surveillance systems \\nand biometric-powered access control systems on the privacy of \\npeople by issuing certain guidelines.\\nIMPACT LEVEL :\\nHIGH\\nMEDIUM\\nLOW\\nVERY LOW\\n \\n51 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n5.2.2.1 \\nHigh installation, maintenance, and ownership costs of \\ncommercial security systems \\nHigh costs associated with the installation and maintenance of access control systems is expected to be \\nthe key factor hindering the growth of the market. Customers are increasingly becoming aware of the \\nbenefits of access control systems; however, expensive hardware and the high cost of ownership have \\nhampered its adoption to a great extent in emerging countries. Expensive hardware and consultation \\nregarding the use of these systems increase the installation cost. Similarly, the cost of ownership will be \\neven higher as it includes maintenance charges, monitoring subscription fees, the replacement cost of \\nparts, as well as installation costs. Also, software solutions installed in the access control system for \\nadvanced analytics are expensive, which also adds to the overall cost of a device. Thus, the high cost of \\nadvanced multilevel access control solutions is a major market restraint. Moreover, the threat of hackers \\naffects the perception of consumers regarding the reliability of access control systems operated through \\nmobile phones. If not updated timely, wireless access control solutions can become vulnerable to hackers. \\nFurther, as such devices operate on battery power or electrical supply, power failure or exhausted batteries \\ncould disrupt their functioning. \\nSimilarly, high initial investments are required for the implementation of fire protection systems. This is due \\nto the complexity of networks and the need to develop sophisticated tools to counter a fire situation. Due \\nto this, vendors need to upgrade their solutions and develop new technologies regularly. Companies are \\nspending a large amount of money on developing these advanced technologies, thereby increasing the \\ncost of procurement for enterprises and government agencies to provide complete fire protection to \\ninfrastructure. Also, regular maintenance, along with other services, is essential for fire protection systems; \\nthis increases operational costs. These systems require routine inspection and testing to keep them in line \\nwith the code requirements of NFPA and the International Code Council (ICC). The maintenance of these \\nfire protection systems requires inspection of thermal insulation, joints, alternative enclosures, and so on, \\nat regular intervals. Additionally, enterprises need to review building certifications that depend on the age \\nof a building structure. These factors add up to the costs; thus, high initial costs act as a restraint for the \\ngrowth of the market. \\n5.2.2.2 \\nMajor security and pri vacy concerns  \\nVideo surveillance systems are used in private and public domains in areas where security is of utmost \\nimportance, such as highways, parking lots, parks, transportation platforms, retail stores, financial and \\neducational institutions, and offices. While such systems facilitate theft control and overall security, video \\nsurveillance is often viewed as a violation of privacy and is opposed by several civil liberties groups and \\nactivists. People expect that their personal information is used only for legitimate and specific purposes, \\nand there have been concerns about who watches the video and how the video might be used or misused.  \\nIn most industries, physical and logical security are separate departments as their requirements and \\napproaches are different. An access control system is always prone to threats from anyone with an \\nintention to breach either physical or logical security. Even in the case of integrated IT and security \\nsystems, cyberattacks are common. Security systems are being developed to overcome and block these \\nthreats; however, a system that gives complete security—physical and logical—has not yet been developed \\nor implemented. Moreover, ACaaS, being a completely cloud-based solution, is prone to data breaches and \\ncyberattacks. Any security concern, such as data breach and unauthorized access to resources, can lead to \\nsignificant monetary and reputational losses. Weak authentication and abuse of access authority are the \\nmajor reasons behind data breaches in ACaaS. The centralization of identity and access management is \\nconsidered to be the best way to trace the source of disruption or attack. \\nThe increasing interconnectivity of IoT-enabled devices for sharing and collecting data increases the \\nnumber of vulnerabilities within a system significantly. Also, government agencies, data collectors, and \\nhackers may get unauthorized access to critical information while it is in transit. This might compromise \\nnot only the privacy of an individual but also pose a security threat. If personal information is passed to a \\n \\n52 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\nnon-intended recipient, it may be misused and lead to a security breach. Thus, the risk of cyberattacks \\nthrough smart devices or IoT-enabled devices hinders the growth of this market. Therefore, the threat of \\nattacks on physical and logical assets persists.  \\nGovernments and private sector organizations should take necessary steps to lower the impact of video \\nsurveillance systems and biometric-powered access control systems on the privacy of people by issuing \\ncertain guidelines. For example, liberal democracies have laws that restrict the use of surveillance and \\nbiometric authorization by the domestic government and private organizations, limiting it to circumstances \\nwhere public safety is at risk. \\n5.2.3 \\nOPPORTUNITIES  \\n  FIGURE 22 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND THEIR IMPACT \\n \\nSource: Expert Interviews and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n5.2.3.1 \\nGrowing government and stakeholder funding for developing \\nsmart cities and employing city surveillance solutions  \\nNowadays, cities need innovative solutions to overcome long-term challenges such as controlling traffic \\nflows, managing waste, meeting energy efficiency targets, controlling security breaches, and managing city \\nsurveillance owing to rapid urbanization. Governments in developing economies, including China and India, \\nare focusing on developing smart cities, through huge government and stakeholder funding, to curb the \\nlong-term challenges arising from growing urbanization. Video surveillance can be used efficiently for traffic \\nmonitoring, operations monitoring, law enforcement, vandalism deterrence, and remote and mobile \\nmonitoring applications. With increasing threats from terrorism, both international and domestic, public-\\nconcentrated areas, including government offices, buildings, schools, prisons, and parks, are exposed to \\nsecurity threats. Thus, governments across the world, especially in developing countries, are concentrating \\non investing more in video surveillance through smart city and city surveillance projects.  \\n5.2.3.2 \\nRising adoption of ACaaS and VSaaS \\nVSaaS is web-hosted, cloud-based video surveillance. It allows users to remotely store, manage, record, \\nplay, and monitor surveillance footage entirely on the cloud or secure servers. The advantages of such \\nservices include cost efficiency, remote access to data, secure data storage, and high reliability. Low \\ncapital investment is required to use these services. The increase in demand for real-time and remote \\naccess for surveillance data and the flexible scalability offered by VSaaS are likely to provide lucrative \\nopportunities to players in the video surveillance market. \\nOPPORTUNITIES\\n2 YEARS\\n5 YEARS\\nREASON\\nGrowing government and \\nstakeholder funding for \\ndeveloping smart cities and \\nemploying city surveillance \\nsolutions\\n\\uf06e\\n\\uf06e\\nGovernments in developing economies, including China and \\nIndia, are focusing on developing smart cities, through huge \\ngovernment and stakeholder funding, to curb the long-term \\nchallenges arising from growing urbanization. . \\nRising adoption of ACaaS\\nand VSaaS\\n\\uf06e\\n\\uf06e\\nVSaaS is web-hosted, cloud-based video surveillance.

These access control products are connected to the internet, which gives companies \\ncentralized access to all facilities. The option of ACaaS is cost effective and flexible compared to other \\noptions such as a virtual private network (VPN) and other types of traditional access controls. A typical \\npower and utility company has a large mobile workforce of linemen and technicians who need to access \\nremote facilities; ACaaS enables centralized access control to remote facilities. For instance, if any worker \\nis fired, one just needs to log in to the administrative account of the concerned worker and revoke all his \\npermissions. In addition, many companies are introducing advanced ACaaS. The use of access control \\nsystems is expected to grow owing to the following reasons: increasing need to monitor visitor access from \\na central location; growing requirement to integrate customized blast-proof, fireproof, and high-security \\ndoors with access control systems to restrict access to off-limit areas; and surging demand for access \\ncontrol-integrated mechanical locks, electromechanical locking systems, and padlocks.  \\n5.2.3.3 \\nIncreasing periodic revision of fire protection -related regulatory \\ncompliances \\nAuthorities in most developed countries, such as the US, Canada, and Japan, have amended their standard \\nbuilding codes for mandates related to fire suppression system installations. For example, the impact of \\nthe Sarbanes–Oxley Act on US-based companies has changed the fiduciary responsibilities of executive \\nleadership, which now is not just about financial reporting but extends to all areas of risk management, \\nincluding safety concerns. As a result, firms are spending millions of dollars to evaluate and correct \\nshortcomings in fire suppression systems of their facilities, especially in locations where firefighting \\ninfrastructure is weak.  \\nRevised codes mandate the installation of fire alarm equipment in all offices, commercial and \\nmanufacturing sites, and educational and entertainment buildings. The revision of codes is directly related \\nto the secular trends in the overall market for fire alarm equipment. Buildings under renovation are also \\nincluded in the amended codes, resulting in further growth of the market. The Americans with Disabilities \\nAct (ADA) is the latest act that focuses on the safety and security of disabled citizens and mandates the \\ninstallation of visual devices (strobes) to alert the hearing impaired in a rescue situation. \\n5.2.4 \\nCHALLENGES  \\n  FIGURE 23 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET CHALLENGES AND THEIR IMPACT \\n \\nSource: Expert Interviews and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n \\n \\nCHALLENGES\\n2 YEARS\\n5 YEARS\\nREASON\\nCybersecurity-related \\nthreats\\n\\uf06e\\n\\uf06e\\nIP networks allow for more intelligence for surveillance than legacy \\nanalog networks.

IP \\nnetworks allow for more intelligence for surveillance than legacy analog networks. The increasing use of \\ncloud-based services can lead to cybersecurity threats for the data that is uploaded to the cloud platform. \\nThe rising deployment of IP and Power over Ethernet (PoE)-based network devices provides several \\nopportunities for cyberattacks, thereby causing cybersecurity threats. Increasing use of wireless systems, \\nIP systems, and cloud services pose a cybersecurity threat to the market. To overcome such threats, \\ncompanies have to take steps, such as undertaking various programs to train and educate dealers and \\nend users about best practices for cybersecurity. Therefore, companies need to adopt an innovative yet \\nprotection-oriented approach to deal with as well as reduce cybersecurity threats across the commercial \\nsecurity market. \\n5.2.4.2 \\nIntegration of user interfaces with fire protection system  \\nA key challenge facing the fire protection system market is the integration of user interfaces when multiple \\nsolutions are being used in a control mechanism. Fire protection systems can be efficient and cost \\neffective if integrated directly into a centralized building control system so that the information can be \\nobtained from a central point, and corresponding follow-up regulatory measures can proceed automatically \\nin an emergency.  \\nBy integrating these systems, a user can monitor the status of multiple systems from one location or \\naccess features such as remote notification, trending, or maintenance management, which may not be \\navailable directly through a fire protection system. Threats regarding security and fire protection to \\nindustries and commerce in the modern era, with more demanding compliance codes and standards, raise \\nthe need for more comprehensive and integrated solutions. However, owing to the complexity of the \\nsystem and the increasing number of components that are included in it, the integration and configuration \\nof the entire system becomes complicated. This factor poses a challenge for the market. \\n \\n55 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n6 \\nINDUSTRY TRENDS \\n \\n6.1 \\nVALUE CHAIN ANALYSIS \\nValue chain analysis is a systematic approach to examining all the activities occurring throughout the \\nproduction of security systems.

Any country can adopt and adapt to these jurisdictions. These codes have \\nbeen adopted in most of the US. However, these codes have not been adopted on a wide scale anywhere \\nelse in the world. \\nThe IFC and IBC are published every 3 years by the International Code Council (ICC), a group formed in the \\nUS in 2003, with the latest edition published in 2018. The IBC deals with fire prevention in the \\nconstruction and design of new buildings, while the IFC deals with fire prevention and fire risks associated \\nwith a completed and occupied building or facility. The IFC is in use or adopted in 42 US states, including \\nthe District of Columbia, New York City, Guam, and Puerto Rico. The following are the major benefits of IFC \\nstandards: \\n\\uf06e \\nThe provisions of this code provide protection for public health, safety, and welfare from the \\nhazards of fire, explosion, or dangerous conditions in buildings, structures, and premises. \\n\\uf06e \\nThis model code is flexible in that it allows for the use of alternative and innovative materials \\nand performance-based methods in achieving code compliance. \\n\\uf06e \\nThis code does not give undue preferential treatment to particular types or classes of materials, \\nproducts, or construction methods. \\n\\uf06e \\nThis code references nationally developed consensus standards. \\n\\uf06e \\nThis code addresses extraordinary fire risks in existing buildings with retrospective \\nrequirements, but only in this limited area is there a need for alterations, as long as the building \\nand its occupancies comply with reasonable fire prevention provisions. \\n\\uf06e \\nThis code includes reasonable yet comprehensive regulations for hazardous materials. \\n\\uf06e \\nThis code includes requirements or expanded requirements for vacant premises, indoor \\ndisplays, fire protection water supply, fire apparatus access roads, key boxes, high-piled \\nstorage, tire rebuilding and tire storage, mechanical refrigeration systems, explosion control, \\nsmoke and heat vents, and lead-acid battery systems. \\nThe EN Eurocodes is the code used as a model for structural design.

A company with operations confined to a particular jurisdiction ensures that its \\nvideo surveillance practices comply with the local laws. However, an MNC faces a much more complex \\nchallenge. The reason being that legal implications differ so widely for different regions and companies \\nhave to adapt their practices specific to each area.

The UK Information \\nCommissioner issues specific guidance on the use of video surveillance in the workplace and considers it \\nlegal only if the conditions of the UK Information Commissioner\\'s CCTV Code of Practice 1998 are adhered \\nto. \\nIn Spain, the use of video cameras raises data protection law issues similar to those of the UK, as most EU \\ncountries have enacted data laws that are consistent with Directive 46/1995/EC on data protection (Data \\nProtection Directive). \\nThe US has no comprehensive data protection statute analogous to the Data Protection Directive. \\nHowever, there are sector-specific federal and state privacy laws imposing some limits on video \\nsurveillance in the workplace. Most significant US laws affecting video surveillance are state and federal \\nstatutes that mainly regulate wiretapping-related laws. Since wiretapping laws focus on sound recording, \\nvideo surveillance with an audio track is subject to the US federal wiretapping law, the Electronic \\nCommunications Privacy Act 1996 (ECPA), and some of its related parallel state laws. \\n \\n \\n \\n59 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n6.3.3 \\nGOVERNMENT REGULATIONS RELATED TO FAIR AND TRANSPARENT \\nUSE OF BIOMETRIC SYSTEM-POWERED ACCESS CONTROL \\nAccording to the World Economic Forum (WEF) Head of Artificial Intelligence Kay Firth-Butterfield, as \\ngovernments have started deploying facial recognition technology-based access control systems, they must \\nstart considering the privacy of individuals as well. It has also been suggested that the potential for facial \\nrecognition can hamper citizens’ civil liberties, which need to be handled carefully. The WEF is advising \\ngovernments to ensure the transparent and fair use of facial recognition systems in the public and private \\nsectors. Scottish Parliament’s Justice Sub-Committee on Policing will look into the use of facial recognition \\nin law enforcement and invasive monitoring of citizens’ privacy. For instance, as of December 2019, in \\nBeijing, the use of the internet through a phone or computer cannot be done without a facial recognition \\ncheck. In recent years, many people have been arrested for posting sensitive topics about the government \\non the internet. Addressing these concerns with strong legislation from governments will go a long way in \\nfurther unlocking the potential use of biometric systems in the private and government sectors. \\n6.4 \\nKEY USE CASES \\n6.4.1 \\nFIRE PROTECTION SYSTEM \\n6.4.1.1 \\nFire protection systems played major role in fighting Australian \\nwildfires  \\nWildfires in Australia burned 100,000 sq km of land in Australia from July 2019 to January 2020. \\nFirefighting crews have used a combination of aircraft, including helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, and \\nlarger air-tankers dropping water and retardants onto the fires from the sky.

The \\nchanges in these forces can have a significant impact on the commercial security system market. Porter’s \\nfive forces analyze the competition in the commercial security system market from 5 different \\nperspectives, namely the intensity of rivalry within a market, the threat from new entrants, bargaining \\npower of suppliers, bargaining power of buyers, and threat from substitutes. \\n  TABLE 5 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET: PORTER’S FIVE FORCES ANALYSIS \\nPORTER’S FIVE FORCES \\nIMPACT \\nDegree of Competition \\nHigh \\nBargaining Power of Suppliers \\nMedium \\nBargaining Power of Buyers \\nMedium \\nThreat from Substitutes \\nLow \\nThreat from New Entrants \\nMedium \\nSource: Secondary Literature, Expert Interviews, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\nCompetitive rivalry and the bargaining power of buyers are the major forces influencing the commercial \\nsecurity system market. This market has many players, both established and start-up companies, that have \\nproduct portfolios with unique value propositions—some targeted toward high-end buyers. Companies \\ndesign and manufacture hardware component, develop software in-house or outsource it to a third-party, \\nand mostly the manufacturers provide services themselves. However, companies retain their intellectual \\nproperty rights. This has ultimately resulted in a medium impact on the bargaining power of suppliers in the \\ncommercial security system market. However, good interoperability among different commercial security \\ndevices has given buyers some freedom to choose their desired commercial security systems. \\n6.7 \\nAVERAGE SELLING PRICE \\n  TABLE 6 \\nAVERAGE SELING PRICE OF COMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM HARDWARE,  \\n2020–2026 (USD) \\nOffering \\n2020 \\n2022 \\n2024 \\n2026 \\nVideo Surveillance Camera \\n200–400 \\n196–390 \\n190–375 \\n185–365 \\nAccess Control System \\n150–250 \\n140–235 \\n130–220 \\n120–200 \\nEntrance Control System \\n450–550 \\n440–535 \\n430–520 \\n420–500 \\nSource: Secondary Research, Expert Interviews, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n  TABLE 7 \\nAVERAGE SELING PRICE OF VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CAMERA, BY TYPE, 2020 (USD) \\ntype \\nAVERAGE SELLING PRICE (ASP) PER UNIT \\nWireless/IP Camera \\n200–300 \\nWired/CCTV Camera \\n150–250 \\nSource: Secondary Research, Expert Interviews, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n \\n63 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n  TABLE 8 \\nAVERAGE SELING PRICE OF ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM, BY TYPE, 2020 (USD) \\ntype \\nAVERAGE SELLING PRICE (ASP) PER UNIT \\nCard-based Readers \\n130–180 \\nBiometric Readers \\n180–230 \\nElectronic Locks \\n110–160 \\nSource: Secondary Research, Expert Interviews, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\nThe historic and forecast prices were compiled from various sources, such as tier-1 supply portals, press \\nreleases, company presentations, industry experts, white papers, and the MnM data repository. Upon \\nanalysis, the projected price was derived based on OEM announcements, contracts, new product \\ndevelopments, projected future demand, and historical price trends. \\nEntrance control system units are more expensive than other products primarily due to them being a form \\nof electronic door, making it much larger in size and complicated to build. These costs do not include \\ninstallation costs and only cover the unit price of the product. \\n6.7.1 \\nPRICING TREND FOR COMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET \\nAn access control system is the most technology-intensive product and is also a relatively newer \\ntechnology. Its prices are expected to decline way more rapidly compared to the other 2 products. \\nMoreover, the emergence and growth of new-generation contactless technologies are further accelerating \\nthe trend of declining prices as these next-generation technologies will witness a quick adoption only when \\nprocesses decline. Entrance control systems will witness a relatively slower decline in price compared to \\naccess control primarily because it is not an R&D-intensive industry with most of the innovation being in \\nthe area of integration of entrance control systems with different technologies. Video surveillance is also \\nexpected to witness a fall in price primarily because of the increase in shipments and entry of aggressive \\nnew entrants, predominantly from China.  \\n6.8 \\nTECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS \\nThere has been a lot of innovations happening in the commercial security system market. These \\ninnovations perform a crucial role in improving the level of security provided by these systems.  \\n6.8.1 \\nIOT-POWERED FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEM \\nIoT is an ever-growing network of people, as well as smart devices, machines, and other devices that \\nfeature an internet protocol (IP) address for internet connectivity to exchange data for intelligent machine \\napplications and services. It allows objects to be controlled and sensed remotely across existing network \\ninfrastructure, making integration between physical and digital worlds more efficient, accurate, and \\neconomically beneficial. \\nThe increased number of fire accidents globally is a primary factor raising the demand for the integration of \\nIoT with fire protection devices to prevent fire accidents. Sensors and actuators are connected to \\nsmartphones via an IP, which sends emergency alerts to the fire brigade about fire accidents. \\nTechnological advancements in wireless solutions and the evolution of IoT may have a transformative \\nimpact on various industry verticals, especially in building management. This technology integrates fire \\nprotection and life safety devices, where fire alarm panels, detectors, and other devices are connected \\ntogether to improve safety and operations, thus making it cost efficient. At present, IoT is not connected \\ndirectly to most fire protection systems and probably will not be for quite some time as systems need to be \\nupgraded with Underwriters Laboratories (UL) standards.  \\n \\n \\n \\n64 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n6.8.2 \\nCLOUD-BASED FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEM \\nFire departments have identified the need to modernize administrative functions by making the transition \\nfrom paper-driven management systems to paperless technology solutions. Paperless solutions help in \\nmanaging a variety of administrative tasks, such as supply chain for all consumable products and \\nequipment, asset management for facilities, and personnel record management.  \\nFire protection systems are being designed, keeping in view the experiences of firefighters and are being \\nmade compatible with cloud-based software, which can provide access to information from anywhere. \\nCloud-based systems also eliminate the need for keeping software on individual machines or devices and \\nensure that a firefighting department’s software is always updated with the latest, real-time information. \\nWith the use of cloud-based solutions, fire safety plans are now digital and free for fire services. \\nFirefighters can access floor plans and critical infrastructure. Also, fire department personnel can conduct \\nsafety sessions with building residents from the station at any time. \\n6.8.3 \\nVIDEO IMAGE SMOKE AND FLAME DETECTION SYSTEM \\nVideo image smoke and flame detection systems are a new trend in the FPS market. These systems are \\ngenerally used to protect large areas that are prone to fire accidents and protect assets with high value. \\nThey are mostly preferred in industrial plants, turbines, chemical laboratories, and oil & gas facilities. They \\nrequire at least some light in the room to detect smoke, but they do not need light for flame detection.  \\nVideo image smoke and flame detection systems are offered with a digital camera that is linked to a video \\nanalytics software programmed on a computer. Video cameras are grouped in a network, and the images \\nare sent to the computer programmed with video analytics software.  \\nThe software determines the presence of fire through captured video images. These systems use different \\nlenses that are capable of capturing large areas. The captured images are analyzed multiple times by the \\nsoftware. Cameras analyze each pixel in the image. These systems detect the brighter pixels and identify \\nfire based on the brightness. If a fire is detected, a signal is sent to the fire alarm control panel that alerts \\nresidents or fire brigades. These systems should comply with the NFPA 72 standard. Software and \\nhardware components used in these systems should be UL-listed. \\n6.8.4 \\nEMERGENCE OF CONTACTLESS BIOMETRICS \\nContactless biometric solutions primarily use technologies such as iris recognition, face recognition, or \\nvoice recognition. COVID-19 has made people wary of using touch-based biometrics as these carry a risk of \\nthe spread of the disease. This has led to encouragement from companies and people to adopt contactless \\nbiometric solutions based on face, iris, and voice recognition technologies. As a result, secure contactless \\nfinancial transactions are likely to increase. Similarly, at the government level, contactless biometric \\ntechnology is gaining traction to be integrated into passports. Along with it, schools, hospitals, and other \\npublic institutions have also started deploying contactless biometric systems for security purposes. \\nGrowth in digital banking is a major driver for the adoption of facial, voice, or iris recognition technologies \\nin the BFSI sector. Its use makes it a convenient and user-friendly way for customer verification, which \\nhelps deliver secure authentication across the channels. Along with it, software vendors have started \\nproviding advanced development kits, which help contactless biometric technology providers offer \\nadvanced contactless biometric software along with hardware. There has been a decline in cash circulation \\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic. People have started using contactless payment options during this \\npandemic, and they are likely to become comfortable with contactless transactions. Mobile wallets, \\ncoupled with the in-phone biometric authentication process, is another key factor boosting the growth of \\nthe contactless biometric market. \\n \\n \\n \\n65 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n6.8.5 \\nUSE OF THERMAL CAMERAS IN ACCESS CONTROL \\nWhen it comes to continuous, reliable detection with a low rate of false alarms, thermal cameras are the \\nobvious choice. Thermal cameras work far better than visual cameras in a dark environment. They detect \\npeople and objects, as well as incidents 24/7, everywhere from dark areas to sunlight areas. These are \\nalso less sensitive to different lighting conditions, such as shadows, backlight, and darkness. Thermal \\ncameras are capable of performing in difficult weather conditions, such as smoke, haze, dust, and light \\nfog. As thermal cameras can detect even a minor change in temperature, it is difficult for a human to blend \\nwith the background. Therefore, thermal cameras are excellent at detecting humans obscured by complex \\nbackgrounds or hidden in deep shadows. In addition, objects such as vehicles also have a different \\ntemperature than the surrounding environment, making detection easy. A combination of thermal cameras \\nwith an access control system helps to keep premises secure. A majority of break-ins occur through forcible \\nentry; the use of thermal cameras helps prevent burglary.  \\nThermal cameras are used in a wide range of security applications, such as perimeter protection around \\nindustrial and commercial sites, airports, and power plants. Face recognition technology combined with \\naccess control helps in border control. Governments and law enforcement agencies across the world have \\nstarted implementing thermal cameras in public places, such as airports, malls, railway stations, and \\ntunnels, for public security and access control. \\n6.8.6 \\n3D FACE RECOGNITION \\n3D face recognition is a critical innovation in the biometric system-powered access control market. It uses \\nfacial biometrics based on the detailed measurements of rigid tissues and cranial structures. The 3D \\nbiometric template is obtained from the precise geometric data accurate up to the sub-millimeter of the \\ncranial curvature, where rigid tissues are most visible, such as areas around eye sockets, superciliary \\narches, the chin zone, and the bridge of a nose. The structured light approach from 3D face readers throws \\nan infrared pattern of grid light on the user’s face to map the geographic pattern of the face. It uses \\ndistortions caused by the grid pattern to 3D map the face and from different facial positions. This makes \\nthe verification process fast as the user needs to pause only for a short period in front of the reader. \\n6.8.7 \\nINTELLIGENT AND CONTEXT-AWARE VIDEO DATA COLLECTION \\nAdvancements in the signal processing technology enable the development of intelligent video surveillance \\nsystems that can flexibly adapt the rate of video data collection. Whenever there is a security incident, the \\nindicator sends a signal to increase the rate of data collection, which can provide more detailed \\ninformation to help with an accurate and credible analysis of the incident. \\n6.8.8 \\nMOBILE ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM \\nMobile access control refers to using a smartphone to identify a person and granting/denying access to an \\nentrance. In the past, physical access control systems, such as keys, magnetic stripe cards, proximity \\ncards, were generally used to enable access to a building. Now, credential technology has been developed \\nusing near-field communication (NFC) and Bluetooth technologies. Mobile access control is a standard \\nmethod that supports a growing number of products and technology platforms. Various access control \\nsystems offer application-based mobile integration that allows users to install and use apps in their \\nsmartphones to interact with access control systems. However, sometimes, these apps are designed with \\nlimited features and capabilities. Avigilon Corporation (Canada) provides Access Control Manager, a \\nbrowser-based access control system with full manageability that connects to any smartphone or tablet. \\nThis application allows multiple operators to connect and operate simultaneously. ACM is a browser-based \\nsystem, which means a user can access it from anywhere. Also, HID Global (US) is one of the worldwide \\nleaders of identity solutions. Millions of people in healthcare, education, financial, government sectors \\nacross the world use HID products and services. HID Global has been launching several new products \\nbased on the Seos platform, including readers and cards. The company focuses on providing advanced \\ntechnology platform-based mobile access control solutions. \\n \\n66 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n6.9 \\nTRADE AND TARIFF ANALYSIS \\n6.9.1 \\nTRADE ANALYSIS FOR VIDEO SURVEILLANCE \\nCommercial security system hardware includes access control systems, video surveillance, fire protection \\nsystems, and entrance control systems.

The growth of the \\nmarket for fire sprinklers is driven by the increase in fire protection-related expenditure of various \\nenterprises, rise in fire-related deaths, and governmental norms.  \\n7.2.2 \\nFIRE DETECTION \\nFire detection systems are a critical part of any building design. Fire detectors are available for residential, \\ncommercial, and industrial use. Such systems are permanently installed manual and automatic systems \\nthat detect fires at an early stage and quickly inform the relevant emergency service. Fire detection \\nproducts such as flame detectors, smoke detectors, and heat detectors alert occupants through alarms, as \\nwell as trigger automatic fire extinguishers such as sprinklers. Successful fire prevention and protection \\ndepends on the performance of fire detection products; thus, they are expected to offer accurate and early \\ndetection of fire.  \\n7.2.2.1 \\nFlame detectors \\nA flame detector or sensor is an optical fire detection device that detects and responds to flame or fire. \\nFlame detectors are designed to detect the absorption of light at specific wavelengths and discriminate \\nbetween flames and false alarm sources. A key advantage of an optical flame detector is its ability to \\ndetect small fire from a long distance. Flame detectors identify flames via optical methods such as \\nultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy and visual flame imaging.  \\nFlame detectors are available in 2 categories—detectors in fire alarm systems for noticing fire and \\nscanners for monitoring the condition of a flame in a burner. Halma, Honeywell International, Johnson \\nControls, and Spectrex are among the companies that provide fire flame detectors. The market for flame \\ndetectors has been segmented based on type into single IR, single UV, dual UV/IR, multi IR, and triple IR \\n(IR3). The growing use of flame detectors in indoor applications across verticals has boosted the growth of \\nthis market.  \\n \\n \\n \\n78 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n7.2.2.2 \\nSmoke detectors \\nSmoke detectors are designed to provide early warning of a potential fire involving ordinary combustible \\nmaterials. The installation of smoke detectors in buildings to identify fires has been in practice much \\nbefore that of flame and heat detectors. Fire creates smoke that spreads faster than the actual fire; \\ntherefore, smoke detectors can detect fire, trigger fire alarms, and warn occupants about the fire. There \\nare 3 main types of smoke detectors based on smoke sensing technology—ionization, photoelectric, and a \\ncombination of both.  \\n7.2.2.3 \\nHeat detectors \\nHeat detectors respond to the thermal energy of fire. Heat detectors trigger fire alarms when the \\ntemperature of the building increases beyond the predetermined limit. Such detectors are generally \\nlocated at or near the ceiling of a building and are best suited for fire detection in small, confined spaces, \\nwhere rapidly growing, high-heat-output fires may be expected. These detectors respond either at a fixed \\ntemperature, a specified rate of temperature change, or both. There are several types of heat detectors, \\nsuch as mechanical heat detectors, electronic heat detectors, fixed-temperature heat detectors, and linear \\nheat detectors. System Sensor, Apollo Fire Detectors, Honeywell, and Siemens are among the suppliers of \\nheat detectors. \\n  TABLE 29 \\nCOMMERCIAL FIRE DETECTION SYSTEM HARDWARE MARKET, BY REGION,  \\n2017–2020 (USD MILLION) \\nRegion  \\n2017 \\n2018 \\n2019 \\n2020 \\nNorth America  \\n 1,018  \\n 1,106  \\n 1,200  \\n 1,106  \\nEurope  \\n 757  \\n 814  \\n 874  \\n 797  \\nAPAC  \\n 593  \\n 650  \\n 712  \\n 670  \\nRoW  \\n 280  \\n 302  \\n 325  \\n 298  \\nTotal  \\n 2,648  \\n 2,873  \\n 3,110  \\n 2,871  \\nSource: Fire Protection Association, National Fire Sprinkler Association, American Fire Sprinkler Association, Alarm Association of \\nFlorida, Fire Suppression Systems Association (FSSA), Fire Protection Association Australia (FPA Australia), National Fire Protection \\nAssociation, Company Websites, Expert Interviews, White Papers, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n  TABLE 30 \\nPOST-COVID-19 COMMERCIAL FIRE DETECTION SYSTEM HARDWARE MARKET,  \\nBY REGION, 2021–2026 (USD MILLION) \\nRegion \\n2021 \\n2022 \\n2023 \\n2024 \\n2025 \\n2026 \\nCAGR \\n(2021–2026) \\nNorth America  \\n 1,173  \\n 1,267  \\n 1,362  \\n 1,457  \\n 1,550  \\n 1,635  \\n6.9% \\nEurope  \\n 837  \\n 894  \\n 952  \\n 1,008  \\n 1,061  \\n 1,108  \\n5.8% \\nAPAC  \\n 716  \\n 780  \\n 847  \\n 914  \\n 980  \\n 1,043  \\n7.8% \\nRoW  \\n 313  \\n 335  \\n 357  \\n 378  \\n 398  \\n 416  \\n5.8% \\nTotal  \\n 3,040  \\n 3,276  \\n 3,517  \\n 3,757  \\n 3,989  \\n 4,203  \\n6.7% \\nSource: Fire Protection Association, National Fire Sprinkler Association, American Fire Sprinkler Association, Alarm Association of \\nFlorida, Fire Suppression Systems Association (FSSA), Fire Protection Association Australia (FPA Australia), National Fire Protection \\nAssociation, Company Websites, Expert Interviews, White Papers, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n79 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n  TABLE 31 \\nPRE-COVID-19 COMMERCIAL FIRE DETECTION SYSTEM HARDWARE MARKET,  \\nBY REGION, 2021–2026 (USD MILLION) \\nRegion \\n2021 \\n2022 \\n2023 \\n2024 \\n2025 \\n2026 \\nCAGR \\n(2021–2026) \\nNorth America  \\n 1,407  \\n 1,515  \\n 1,624  \\n 1,733  \\n 1,838  \\n 1,940  \\n6.6% \\nEurope  \\n 1,005  \\n 1,071  \\n 1,137  \\n 1,201  \\n 1,261  \\n 1,317  \\n5.6% \\nAPAC  \\n 850  \\n 924  \\n 999  \\n 1,075  \\n 1,151  \\n 1,225  \\n7.6% \\nRoW  \\n 373  \\n 398  \\n 422  \\n 446  \\n 468  \\n 489  \\n5.6% \\nTotal  \\n 3,635  \\n 3,908  \\n 4,183  \\n 4,455  \\n 4,719  \\n 4,972  \\n6.5% \\nSource: Fire Protection Association, National Fire Sprinkler Association, American Fire Sprinkler Association, Alarm Association of \\nFlorida, Fire Suppression Systems Association (FSSA), Fire Protection Association Australia (FPA Australia), National Fire Protection \\nAssociation, Company Websites, Expert Interviews, White Papers, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\nOil, gas, and mining is one of the most fire-sensitive verticals in which a fire accident can harm lives and \\ncause maximum resource damage. Therefore, this vertical has a high demand for the deployment of \\nadvanced fire detection products, such as smoke detectors and flame detectors. These products detect \\nfire immediately and help in its rapid prevention. \\n7.2.3 \\nFIRE SUPPRESSION  \\nA fire suppression system starts operating once it receives fire alerts from different sensors and detectors. \\nBy product, the fire suppression market has been segmented into fire sprinklers, nozzles, caps, and control \\nheads; fire suppressors; and fire detectors and control panels. Fire suppressors are used to prevent the \\nspread of fire and put it out. Fire extinguishers spray water, foam, carbon dioxide (CO2), and other fire-\\nresistant materials to control fire. Different types of fire extinguishers are used for different types of fires, \\nand accordingly, extinguishers are labeled based on their extinguishing ability. For instance, water \\nextinguishers are used in fires caused by wood, paper, textile, and other carbonaceous materials; these are \\neffective on class A fires. Water foam extinguishers eliminate fire by allowing water to take away the heat \\ncomponent of fire, while foam separates oxygen from the fire. CO2 extinguishers are used in fires caused \\nby electrical equipment, flammable liquids, and petroleum spirits; these are effective on class B and C \\nfires. Dry chemical extinguishers extinguish a fire by interrupting the chemical reaction of fire; these are \\neffective on class A, B, and C fires. Wet chemical extinguishers extinguish a fire by removing heat and \\npreventing barriers between oxygen and fuel, so a fire cannot be reignited; these are effective on class A \\nand K fires. Clean agent extinguishers use both halon and halocarbon, which interrupt the chemical \\nreaction component of fire; these are used on Class B and C fires. Dry powder extinguishers are similar to \\ndry chemical extinguishers that separate fuel from oxygen or remove the heating element of fire; these are \\nused on class D (combustible metal) fires only. \\nFire sprinklers use water to extinguish a fire, and nozzles are used in fire sprinklers to control the direction \\nof a fluid flow, especially to increase velocity. Also, fire extinguishers are used to prevent the spread of a \\nfire and to put it out by spraying water, CO2, and other fire-resistant materials. Fire detectors and control \\npanels include smoke detectors, heat detectors, flame detectors, and gas detectors, which detect and \\nindicate the start of a fire. All these products are part of fire suppression systems that help in preventing \\nand controlling fire. \\n \\n \\n \\n80 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n7.2.3.1 \\nFire detectors and control panels  \\nFire detectors and control panels (including smoke, heat, flame, and gas detectors) play an essential part \\nin fire safety. Fire detectors and control panels are especially used in homes for fire detection. As fires \\nspread, a detector initiates the alarm and warns residents, giving them enough time to get to safety. \\nAccording to the NFPA, a working detector could reduce the chances of fatal fire accidents by 50%. Over \\n60% of all fire-related deaths happen in the residential space due to the absence of detectors. These \\ndevices typically cost ~USD 15–100 and need to be replaced every 10 years. They should also be checked \\nevery 3 months for batteries, which may cost an additional USD 5–10.  \\nA heat detector not only detects smoke but also detects the rise in temperature in a room. It typically costs \\n~USD 60–100 and has high monthly maintenance fees. Flame and gas detectors are also used for \\ndetecting fire. Carbon monoxide (CO) detectors have gained popularity as CO is invisible, odorless, and \\ncolorless. The activation of the detector would initiate the fire suppression system that suppresses the fire \\nthrough various suppression agents. \\n7.2.3.2 \\nFire sprinklers, nozzles, caps, and control heads  \\nA fire sprinkler system consists of components such as fire sprinkler heads, piping, stop valves, alarm \\nvalves, alarm test valves, and motorized alarm bells. Nozzles are used with fire sprinkler systems to control \\nthe flow of water. These are available in different varieties, including spray nozzles (widely used for water \\nmist), cone nozzles (for wet chemical and deluge systems), and foam system nozzles (custom-designed for \\nlow-, medium-, and high-expansion foam systems). Fire sprinkler systems are mostly used in residential, \\ncommercial, and industrial buildings and are now being increasingly used in smart buildings and homes. \\nMoreover, authorities in most developed countries such as the US, Canada, and Japan have amended their \\nstandard building codes and norms to install residential fire sprinklers, thereby contributing to the growth \\nof the fire suppression market.  \\n7.2.3.3 \\nFire suppressor reagent \\nFire suppressors are used to prevent the spread of fire and put it out. By suppression agent, the fire \\nsuppression market has been segmented into chemical, gaseous, water, and foam. Fire suppression \\nsystems suppress fire by immediately releasing a suppression agent. The use of suppression agents in fire \\nsuppression systems varies according to the sector. For instance, the residential sector generally uses \\nwater-based suppression agents, while the industrial sector uses gaseous and foam-based suppression \\nagents due to the critical nature of operations. \\n7 . 2 . 3 . 3 . 1  \\nC h e m i c a l  \\nChemical fire suppression systems are used to restrict fire, coat the fuel that the fire is consuming to \\nprevent contact with oxygen, and reduce combustion ability. Chemical fire suppression systems are \\navailable in 2 forms—dry and wet chemical. Dry chemicals work on class D (combustible metal) fires, while \\nwet chemicals work on class K (kitchen) fires. \\n7 . 2 . 3 . 3 . 2  \\nG a s e o u s  \\nA gaseous agent in a fire suppression system works in one of 2 ways—inert the atmosphere to reduce \\noxygen concentration to a level that can no longer sustain combustion or react chemically with the fire, \\nsubsequently absorbing heat and breaking down the chain reaction of combustion. \\n7 . 2 . 3 . 3 . 3  \\nW a t e r  \\nWater-based fire suppression systems are used to extinguish oil fire and fire involving flammable liquids \\nand gases using water. Such systems are available in 4 forms—wet system, pre-action system, deluge \\nsystem, and dry system. In a wet system, the water in a system’s pipes is ready to be activated by the \\nopening of fire sprinkler heads. The pre-action system is a combination of wet and dry pipe fire sprinkler \\n \\n81 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\nsystems and is not activated until a fire is detected. The deluge system is controlled by a valve that \\nreleases water and is used where fire can spread quickly. A dry system has air in pipes, and water is \\nactivated after a slight delay; these systems are used where water in pipes could freeze. \\n7 . 2 . 3 . 3 . 4  \\nF o a m  \\nFoam-based fire suppression systems use an aggregate of air-filled bubbles formed from aqueous \\nsolutions. The bubbles form a coherent floating blanket on flammable and combustible liquids to prevent \\nor extinguish fires by excluding air and cooling the fuel. After this, the bubbles prevent re-ignition by \\nsuppressing the formation of flammable vapor and sticking to surfaces, thus providing a degree of \\nexposure protection from adjacent fires. Foam systems are widely used to protect flammable liquid storage \\nvessels, aircraft hangars, warehouses, hydrocarbon bulk storage vessels, and fuel loading racks that \\nrequire more than just water-based fire protection.

Sprinkler systems are made up of a \\nnetwork of pipes in the walls and ceilings that have sprinkler heads, providing protection to hallways, \\nrooms, stairways, and other areas of a building. Although fire sprinkler systems are mostly used in \\ncommercial and industrial buildings, they are also being increasingly used in smart buildings and homes. A \\nfire sprinkler system is a fire protection system consisting of components such as fire sprinkler heads, \\nalarm test valves, alarm valves, stop valves, and motorized alarm bells.  \\nFire sprinkler systems contribute significantly to protection from fire-related hazards. These systems can be \\ncategorized into wet sprinkler systems, dry sprinkler systems, pre-action sprinkler systems, deluge \\nsprinklers, and others (foam water sprinkler systems and water spray sprinkler systems). \\n7.2.4.1 \\nWet \\nWet pipe fire sprinklers always have water in them. These are the most commonly used sprinklers and are \\nreliable due to their simplicity in terms of design and ease of operation. Wet pipe systems are commonly \\nused in high-rise or office buildings with a few floors. Such sprinkler systems employ automatic sprinkler \\nheads attached to a piping system containing water and connected to a water supply. The water gets \\ndischarged quickly from the sprinkler opened by excess heat or a rise in temperature in the event of a fire. \\nWet pipe fire sprinkler systems are cost efficient and require low maintenance. \\n  TABLE 35 \\nADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF WET FIRE SPRINKLER SYSTEMS \\nADVANTAGES \\nDISADVANTAGES \\n\\uf0a7 \\nSimple and reliable \\n\\uf0a7 \\nLow cost of installation and maintenance \\n\\uf0a7 \\nEase of modification \\n\\uf0a7 \\nQuick response to fire \\n\\uf0a7 \\nCannot be used in subfreezing environments \\n\\uf0a7 \\nConcerns regarding vandalism \\nSource: Fire Protection Association, National Fire Sprinkler Association, American Fire Sprinkler Association, Alarm Association of \\nFlorida, Fire Suppression Systems Association (FSSA), Fire Protection Association Australia (FPA Australia), National Fire Protection \\nAssociation, Company Websites, Expert Interviews, White Papers, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n \\n83 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n7.2.4.2 \\nDry \\nDry fire sprinklers have been specifically designed for areas where sprinklers may be subjected to freezing \\nconditions. Such conditions are witnessed in buildings/structures in which the pipes may be exposed to \\ntemperatures below 40° F and are thus likely to freeze. In this system, pipes are filled with pressurized air \\nor nitrogen rather than water. A remote, dry pipe valve is held by the pressurized air in a closed position. \\nLocated in a heated space, dry pipe valves prevent water from entering the pipe until a fire causes one or \\nmore sprinklers to operate. This causes the air to escape from the pipe that releases the dry pipe valve. \\nWater then enters the pipe, flowing through open sprinklers onto the fire. \\nAdvantages of dry pipe sprinkler systems \\nUse in cold spaces: Dry pipe sprinkler systems provide automatic protection in cold spaces where freezing \\nis possible. Such systems are typically installed in unheated warehouses and attics, exterior loading docks, \\nand commercial freezers. \\nDisadvantages of dry pipe sprinkler systems \\n\\uf06e \\nComplexity: Dry pipes require additional control equipment and air pressure supply \\ncomponents, which increase the complexity of the system. If not maintained properly, this \\nequipment may be less reliable compared with a wet pipe system. \\n\\uf06e \\nHigh installation and maintenance costs: Increased complexity leads to an increase in the \\noverall dry pipe installation cost. It also increases the maintenance expenditure of the system, \\nprimarily due to added service labor costs. \\n\\uf06e \\nLimited design flexibility: Dry pipe systems have limitations regarding the permitted size \\n(typically 750 gallons). This limits flexibility while designing dry pipe sprinkler systems. \\n\\uf06e \\nDelay in fire response: In dry pipe sprinkler systems, the time duration between the opening of \\nsprinkler and discharge of water onto fire may be up to 60 seconds. This delay in fire \\nextinguishing actions may result in increased damage. \\n\\uf06e \\nIncreased potential for corrosion: Dry pipe sprinkler systems must be kept completely drained \\nand dried after operation. Otherwise, the remaining water may cause pipe corrosion and \\npremature system failure. \\n7.2.4.3 \\nPre-action \\nPre-action fire sprinkler systems are filled with air, and water is allowed to pass through when the smoke \\nalarm or detector goes off. Pre-action fire sprinklers are similar to dry pipe systems, with the only difference \\nbeing that in a pre-action fire sprinkler, water is held from piping by an electrically operated valve, known \\nas a pre-action valve, and the valve operation is controlled by independent flame or smoke detection. Pre-\\naction systems are used in places where sprinklers are necessary when there is an actual fire so that other \\nitems in the building do not experience damage from water due to accidental sprinkling. \\nAdvantages of pre-action sprinkler systems \\n\\uf06e \\nLess risk of inadvertent discharge: The pre-action valve must operate, and sprinkler heads must \\nfuse to initiate pre-action fire sprinklers. This feature reduces the risk of an accidental \\ndischarge. Owing to this, pre-action systems are mostly employed in water-sensitive \\nenvironments such as archival vaults, fine art storage rooms, rare book libraries, and computer \\ncenters. \\n \\n \\n \\n84 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\nDisadvantages of pre-action sprinkler systems \\n\\uf06e \\nHigh installation and maintenance costs: These systems are highly complex due to the presence \\nof additional components, which adds to the overall system cost. \\n\\uf06e \\nDifficult to modify: Modification in pre-action sprinkler systems is limited due to specific size \\nconstraints. \\n\\uf06e \\nLess reliable: High complexity of pre-action systems leads to the possibility of failure of some \\nparts or systems, thereby reducing reliability. \\n \\n7.2.4.4 \\nDeluge \\nA deluge fire sprinkler system is similar to a pre-action system that also needs a smoke or heat detector. \\nDeluge fire sprinkler systems are needed where high-velocity suppression is necessary to prevent fire \\nspread. Deluge fire sprinkler systems are attached to a water supply through a deluge valve that is opened \\nby the operation of a heat or smoke detector. The detector is installed in the same area as the sprinkler. All \\nsprinkler heads in the system discharge water once the detection system gets activated. Deluge systems \\nhelp prevent fire spread in areas where high-velocity suppression is required. Hence, such systems are \\nused in hazardous areas such as power plants, aircraft hangars, and chemical storage or processing \\nfacilities. \\nAdvantages of deluge sprinkler systems \\n\\uf06e \\nProtection of extra-hazardous occupancies: Deluge fire sprinkler systems are employed in areas \\nthat are exposed to liquids with a low flash point or large amounts of combustible liquids. These \\ntypes of hazards may include oil extraction processes, transformers, tank or vessel protection, \\nand distillation processes. \\n \\n7.2.4.5 \\nOther fire sprinkler systems \\nThese include foam water sprinkler systems and water spray sprinkler systems. In a foam water sprinkler \\nsystem, a mixture of water and low-expansion foam concentrate is discharged on the fire. Such systems \\nare used in airport hangars, where associated fire risk is high. \\n  TABLE 36 \\nCOMMERCIAL FIRE SPRINKLER SYSTEM HARDWARE MARKET, BY REGION,  \\n2017–2020 (USD MILLION) \\nRegion  \\n2017 \\n2018 \\n2019 \\n2020 \\nNorth America  \\n 1,437  \\n 1,626  \\n 1,814  \\n 1,707  \\nEurope  \\n 1,125  \\n 1,263  \\n 1,397  \\n 1,305  \\nAPAC  \\n 881  \\n 1,009  \\n 1,150  \\n 1,097  \\nRoW  \\n 424  \\n 478  \\n 532  \\n 498  \\nTotal  \\n 3,867  \\n 4,376  \\n 4,893  \\n 4,607  \\nSource: Fire Protection Association, National Fire Sprinkler Association, American Fire Sprinkler Association, Alarm Association of \\nFlorida, Fire Suppression Systems Association (FSSA), Fire Protection Association Australia (FPA Australia), National Fire Protection \\nAssociation, Company Websites, Expert Interviews, White Papers, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n85 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n  TABLE 37 \\nPOST-COVID-19 COMMERCIAL FIRE SPRINKLER SYSTEM HARDWARE MARKET,  \\nBY REGION, 2021–2026 (USD MILLION) \\nRegion \\n2021 \\n2022 \\n2023 \\n2024 \\n2025 \\n2026 \\nCAGR \\n(2021–2026) \\nNorth America  \\n 1,843  \\n 2,024  \\n 2,214  \\n 2,409  \\n 2,605  \\n 2,795  \\n8.7% \\nEurope  \\n 1,397  \\n 1,523  \\n 1,653  \\n 1,784  \\n 1,913  \\n 2,036  \\n7.8% \\nAPAC  \\n 1,200  \\n 1,335  \\n 1,479  \\n 1,630  \\n 1,784  \\n 1,938  \\n10.1% \\nRoW  \\n 534  \\n 582  \\n 632  \\n 684  \\n 734  \\n 782  \\n7.9% \\nTotal  \\n 4,973  \\n 5,464  \\n 5,978  \\n 6,506  \\n 7,037  \\n 7,551  \\n8.7% \\nSource: Fire Protection Association, National Fire Sprinkler Association, American Fire Sprinkler Association, Alarm Association of \\nFlorida, Fire Suppression Systems Association (FSSA), Fire Protection Association Australia (FPA Australia), National Fire Protection \\nAssociation, Company Websites, Expert Interviews, White Papers, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n  TABLE 38 \\nPRE-COVID-19 COMMERCIAL FIRE SPRINKLER SYSTEM HARDWARE MARKET,  \\nBY REGION, 2021–2026 (USD MILLION) \\nRegion \\n2021 \\n2022 \\n2023 \\n2024 \\n2025 \\n2026 \\nCAGR \\n(2021–2026) \\nNorth America  \\n 2,212  \\n 2,425  \\n 2,646  \\n 2,872  \\n 3,100  \\n 3,327  \\n8.5% \\nEurope  \\n 1,678  \\n 1,825  \\n 1,976  \\n 2,128  \\n 2,278  \\n 2,425  \\n7.6% \\nAPAC  \\n 1,427  \\n 1,585  \\n 1,751  \\n 1,924  \\n 2,102  \\n 2,284  \\n9.9% \\nRoW  \\n 637  \\n 693  \\n 750  \\n 809  \\n 866  \\n 923  \\n7.7% \\nTotal  \\n 5,953  \\n 6,528  \\n 7,122  \\n 7,733  \\n 8,346  \\n 8,959  \\n8.5% \\nSource: Fire Protection Association, National Fire Sprinkler Association, American Fire Sprinkler Association, Alarm Association of \\nFlorida, Fire Suppression Systems Association (FSSA), Fire Protection Association Australia (FPA Australia), National Fire Protection \\nAssociation, Company Websites, Expert Interviews, White Papers, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\nThe growth in the fire sprinkler system market can be attributed to the growth of the industrial sector, \\nwhere the probability of a fire disaster is more due to the presence of flammable materials such as oil and \\ngas. In the energy and power production industry, sprinkler systems are mostly used for fire protection as \\nthey are equipped with hydraulic, pneumatic, or electric triggers and can suppress fire quickly due to open \\nnozzles. The growth of this sector is driving the growth of the fire sprinkler market. Increasing demand for \\nfire sprinkler systems from shopping complexes and offices across the world is also playing a key role in \\ndriving the commercial fire sprinkler system hardware market. \\n7.2.5 \\nFIRE RESPONSE \\nFire response systems are activated simultaneously with fire suppression systems to prevent fire spread. \\nThese systems alert occupants in a building by triggering alarms, siren systems, and warnings by public \\nalerts, and sending emergency messages to police, freighting troops, and ambulance. Fire response \\nsystems considered in this study are emergency lighting systems, public alert systems, secure \\ncommunication systems, and fire alarm devices. \\n \\n \\n \\n86 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n7.2.5.1 \\nEmergency lighting systems \\nAn emergency light is a power-backed lighting device that turns on automatically during situations such as \\nfires. Emergency lights help in routing people in the right direction during emergencies. Emergency lighting \\nsystems are fitted in stairwells, escalators, corridors, ramps, walkways, and exit ways. Spectrum, Fire \\nSystems Inc., and Cooper Lighting and Safety are among the companies that offer emergency lighting \\nsystems. \\n7.2.5.2 \\nVoice evacuation and public alert systems  \\nA voice evacuation life safety system is an effective, fast, and safe means of evacuating or messaging \\noccupants in an emergency. Voice evacuation and public alert systems are the means through which a \\ncontrol center provides information directly to the public through devices such as cell phones, community \\nbroadcast (CB) radios, family radio services, general mobile radio services, amateur radio, 911 calls, public \\nsafety answering point and call dispatch, wireless, and other emergency telephone notification systems. \\n7.2.5.3 \\nSecure communication systems \\nIn an emergency, reliable and quick communication is necessary between emergency units. A well-\\nestablished infrastructure requires first responders such as police force, emergency response teams, and \\nfirefighters in case of fire emergencies. Secure communication allows quick and reliable interaction \\nbetween first responders and the firefighting staff. It enables the quick deployment of response teams to \\nthe affected site. Terma A/S (Denmark) offers a solution called T.react Radio Dispatch, which works on \\nTETRA communication infrastructure for safe communication. \\n7.2.5.4 \\nFire alarm devices \\nFire alarm devices include annunciators, notification devices, and manual pull stations.

These cameras fulfill the varying requirements of non-residential end users, thereby \\ndriving the commercial video surveillance hardware market. \\n7.3.2 \\nCAMERA  \\nVideo surveillance solutions are used for security, monitoring, and analysis. The video surveillance system \\nprimarily consists of hardware products such as cameras, monitors, and storage units, and accessories. Of \\nthe most recent trends in the video surveillance industry, high-definition (HD) cameras, wireless cameras, \\nPTZ, panoramic, spy cameras, and IP cameras are the most attractive. \\nCameras are utilized to capture video footage of places under surveillance and can range from robust \\noutdoor cameras for harsh climates to discreet products for sensitive environments. Cameras with various \\ncapabilities are available in the market, including high definition (HD), wide dynamic range (WDR), infrared \\n(IR), and light finder, which ensures clear video, even in difficult lighting conditions. Cutting-edge cameras \\nbased on innovative technologies and with advanced video analytics features such as motion detection, \\naudio detection, and tempering alarm have also been launched in the market.  \\nSurveillance cameras are broadly divided into analog and IP cameras. An internet protocol camera or IP \\ncamera is a type of a digital video camera commonly deployed for surveillance and which, unlike analog \\n(CCTV) cameras, can send and receive data through a computer network. \\nThe basic stationary camera is appropriate for fixed indoor and fixed location observation applications. The \\nselection of components, such as an imager and a processor, determines the quality of the video data. The \\nimager consists of semiconductor charge-coupled devices (CCDs) or active-coupled or active pixel sensors \\nin Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) to detect and convey the information that \\nconstitutes an image by converting the variable attenuation of light waves into electrical signals that \\nprocess imagery information. The imager digitizes the image data and transmits the information on high-\\nspeed serial links to the processor. The processor provides all the storage, communication, and control \\nfunctions necessary for viewing details that cannot be seen with the human eye. The audio input can \\nprovide audio signals for the monitored video. The control processor acts as a controlling device for all the \\ninterfaces connected. Random access memory (RAM) is used to access memory quickly, and flash memory \\nchips are used to store the video data. The monitoring device is used to monitor activities on a screen.  \\nThe image sensor, the most important part of a surveillance camera, is the electronic component that \\nconverts light into an electrical signal. There are mainly 2 types of image sensors used in cameras—CCD \\nand CMOS. CMOS security cameras use complementary and symmetrical pairs of p-type and n-type metal-\\noxide semiconductor field-effect transistors for logic functions. CMOS image sensors are widely used in \\nsecurity cameras owing to advantages such as high resolution, faster frame rate, low power consumption, \\nand cost effectiveness. In CCD (charged-couple device) cameras, pixels are represented by p-doped metal-\\noxide-semiconductors capacitors. CCD cameras perform well in low-light conditions and have a great wide \\ndynamic range (WDR). \\nThe lens on a video surveillance camera is the first element in the imaging chain, which focuses light or IR \\nenergy from the outside onto the image sensor of the camera. The role of a lens is to deliver an \\nundistorted, evenly focused, accurate image to the imaging sensor. Systems that require superior quality \\nimages start with lenses engineered to produce a high-quality image for the imaging sensor. Lenses are \\ngenerally classified by their focal length, usually stated in millimeters. Based on the focal length distance, \\nthere are 2 major lenses available for video surveillance cameras—fixed focal length lens and varifocal \\nlens. \\n \\n91 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\nThe camera market is primarily made up of 2 types—analog and IP cameras. In recent times, network or IP \\ncameras have gained popularity in video surveillance. Network/IP cameras capture images digitally and \\ntransmit those using standard internet protocols. They are easier to install, have more features, and can be \\nmonitored or configured from anywhere in the world. \\n  TABLE 48 \\nIP CAMERA VS. ANALOG CAMERA \\nFACTOR \\nIP CAMERA \\nANALOG CAMERA \\nVideo Quality \\nIP cameras excel in capturing high-definition \\nmegapixel images but have trouble with low-\\nlighting conditions. \\nAnalog CCD cameras perform well across a \\nvariety of lighting conditions and manage the \\nmotion very well. \\nCabling \\nInfrastructure \\nNetwork wiring by standard follows TIA/EIA-\\n568-B guidelines, which limit the total \\ndistance from switch to camera to 330 feet. \\nUsing active baluns, an analog video can be \\ntransmitted over a mile and power over 1,000 \\nfeet on the standard Cat5 cabling. \\nVideo \\nTransmission \\nIP traffic, like Voice-over-Internet (VoIP), is \\nsubject to potential faults such as bandwidth \\nlimitations, network congestion, varying bit \\nrates, large file sizes, load balancing, viruses, \\nand latency. If the network fails, even \\nmomentarily, the recorded or monitored video \\nwill cease or degrade. \\nAnalog video traffic is not subject to any \\nnetworking issues or risks. The bandwidth is \\nvirtually unlimited. It is a passive connection, \\nsimilar to an analog telephone connection, \\nand cannot be interfered with due to problems \\nexternal to the video surveillance system. \\nFault Tolerance \\nCapacity and \\nReliability \\nWhile some IP cameras can store videos of a \\nlimited size internally, network failure will \\nresult in losing all live viewing and the \\nrecorded server video. \\nAnalog devices are limited to failures of \\nindividual cameras, which means the loss of a \\nsingle piece of hardware will not cause \\nsubstantial degradation of the system. \\nSecurity \\nIP video streams can be encrypted and are \\ndifficult to intercept. On the other hand, the \\nnetwork itself is subject to viruses and other \\ntypes of attacks. \\nAnalog signals are less secure and can be \\nintercepted or viewed by anyone with access \\nto the cabling infrastructure. \\nMaintenance \\nAn IP camera is a network appliance and \\nrequires skilled professionals to operate. \\nAnalog cameras are unmanaged devices; \\nonce installed, they require no skilled \\nprofessionals for operation. \\nWireless \\nOne of the clear advantages of IP cameras is \\ntheir flexibility to integrate with a wireless \\nnetwork. Wireless IP is “virtually” unlimited in \\nterms of expansion and bandwidth, while \\ntopology is still a concern. \\nAnalog cameras use radio frequencies to \\ntransmit \\nvideos \\nand \\npossess \\nlimited \\nbandwidth and transmission speeds. \\nCompatibility \\nIP cameras require a network video recorder \\n(NVR) or browser that will communicate with \\neach model of camera, which is proprietary \\nand unique. \\nAny analog camera can plug into any DVR. \\nThere are no compatibility issues when \\nchanging either the DVR or any of the \\ncameras. \\nScalability \\nOne of the advantages of IP cameras is their \\nability to simply add on cameras by plugging \\ninto any network connection. \\nAnalog cameras can be virtually expanded as \\nthere is no requirement for bandwidth or data \\ntransmission between the cameras and the \\nrecorders. \\nSource: Secondary Sources and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n \\n92 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\nSurveillance cameras, by form, has been divided into dome, pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ), box and bullet, and \\npanoramic, fish-eye, and body-worn cameras. \\nSurveillance cameras used for video surveillance can be categorized on the basis of resolution into the \\nfollowing ranges: 0.3 to 1 megapixel, 1.1 to 2.9 megapixel, 3 to 5 megapixel, and greater than 5 \\nmegapixels. The resolution is measured in vertical and horizontal pixel dimensions.  \\n7.3.3 \\nMONITOR  \\nMonitors are one of the important components of video surveillance systems. A monitor is always a part of \\nthe video surveillance system, be it analog or IP, because it is the only component that analyzes security-\\nrelated threats related to property or humans. Currently available monitors have the ability to endure 24/7 \\nusage and produce highly detailed images necessary for making security-related decisions.  \\nWith advancements in display technology, monitors have also undergone technological improvisation. \\nEarlier, in the conventional CCTV setup, operators could view footage from a central location on a monitor, \\nvery much like a TV, but with higher resolution for better picture quality. Over time, monitors have changed \\nfrom Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) to Liquid–Crystal Display (LCD) and from LCD to Light Emitting Diode (LED) \\ndisplays. LCD and LED monitors offer lower power consumption, lower cost, lower weight, and are smaller \\nin size. \\nMonitors used in video surveillance systems can be categorized on the basis of their screen size into up to \\n20 inches and more than 20 inches.  \\nFactors that must be considered for video surveillance monitors are size, aspect ratio, viewing angle, \\nresolution, imaging performance, brightness, and contrast.  \\n7.3.4 \\nSTORAGE DEVICE  \\nStorage devices have been segmented on the basis of type into Digital Video Recorder (DVR), Network \\nVideo Recorder (NVR), Direct-Attached Storage (DAS), Network-Attached Storage (NAS), and IP Storage Area \\nNetworks (IP SAN).  \\nVideo surveillance systems generate large volumes of critical and sensitive data. As a result, capturing, \\nprotecting, and mobilizing this data is essential for a regular IT framework. White box video servers and \\nstorage solutions, including DAS, NVR, SAN, NAS, are not designed for write-intensive 24/7 IP video \\nsurveillance workloads. \\n7.3.4.1 \\nDigital video recorders \\n7 . 3 . 4 . 1 . 1  \\nC o s t - e f f e c t i v e  s o l u t i o n s  m a i n l y  u s e d  f o r  a n a l o g  c a m e r a s  \\nDigital video recorders (DVRs) are used as storage devices for recording surveillance data. They convert the \\nanalog video file to digital and also allow users to stream a video over a network for remote viewing from \\ndifferent locations. DVRs use hard disk drives (HDDs) or solid-state drives (SSDs) to store the data from \\ncameras. These devices generally do not offer scalability and flexibility in terms of storage space and \\nprovide limited connectivity to cameras. DVRs are considered to be cost-effective storage solutions, and \\nthey mostly work with analog cameras. With the rising use of IP cameras, new-generation DVRs provide \\nrecording over the IP, but they fail to match the operating performance of NVRs.  \\n \\n \\n \\n93 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n7.3.4.2 \\nNetwork video recorders \\n7 . 3 . 4 . 2 . 1  \\nE a s y  t o  d e p l o y  a n d  p r o v i d e  m o r e  f l e x i b i l i t y   \\nAn NVR) is an IP-based recording solution that can record from multiple cameras over a centralized \\nnetwork. NVRs can be connected to all cameras in the local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), \\nor through the internet, thereby providing more flexibility than any other recording solutions available. They \\ncan be accessed and managed remotely through web-based systems. NVRs are categorized into box \\nappliance NVRs and PC-based NVRs.  \\n7.3.5 \\nACCESSORIES  \\nAccessories also play a very important role in the hardware of video surveillance systems. Accessories \\ninclude video encoders and cables.  \\n7.3.5.1 \\nCables \\n2 types of cables are used for the installation of security cameras and DVRs—plug and play (PnP) and \\nRG59 Coax Siamese cables.  \\nThese cables allow both the video and the power to run on one cable. Each cable has a male BNC \\nconnector on each end to connect the security camera to the DVR. The power side of the cable can \\nconnect a surveillance camera\\'s power lead to an individual power supply or to a power supply box through \\na PT-3 power cable lead. \\n7.3.5.2 \\nEncoders \\nThe video encoder, also known as a video server, allows an existing analog CCTV system to be integrated \\nwith a network camera system. When there are many analog cameras to be maintained, the video encoder \\nplays a significant role in the installation. A video encoder camera connects to an analog video camera \\nthrough a coaxial cable and converts analog video signals into digital video streams. The video is sent over \\na wired or wireless IP-based network such as LAN, WLAN, or the internet. To monitor the video or record the \\ndigital video, computer monitors and PCs can be used instead of DVRs or VCRs and analog monitors. \\n7.4 \\nACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM \\n7.4.1 \\nBIOMETRIC READERS TO WITNESS HIGHEST CAGR IN ACCESS \\nCONTROL MARKET, BY HARDWARE, DURING FORECAST PERIOD \\nIn access control systems, different hardware components are used to communicate and authenticate \\ndata and grant/deny access. Various types of hardware products include cards and readers, biometric \\nsystems, electronic locks, multi-technology readers, and control panels or controllers.  \\nMajor Chinese manufacturers of home security systems are headquartered in Hubei Province, the \\nepicenter of the pandemic, thereby impacting domestic vendors such as Hikvision, ZKTeco, and Dahua \\nwith labor shortages and production delays throughout the country. \\nCOVID-19 will have an impact on the global supply of security equipment, which will largely depend on how \\nthe situation stabilizes globally and by when factories resume operations at full capacity. Also, the chances \\nof a trade war between the US and China have led many American suppliers to cautiously stockpile \\nproducts and components manufactured in China. The access control market has potential challenges that \\ncould impact supply chains as the majority of biometric readers are produced by domestic Chinese \\nmanufacturers. Most access control equipment in APAC are also supplied by South Korean, Japanese, and \\nTaiwanese vendors such as Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Secom, NEC Electric, Suprema, and Union Community. If \\nthe number of COVID-19 cases starts increasing again in these countries, the market for biometric readers \\nwill be adversely impacted to a great extent. \\n \\n94 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n  TABLE 49 \\nCOMMERCIAL ACCESS CONTROL MARKET, BY HARDWARE,  \\n2017–2020 (USD MILLION) \\nHardware  \\n2017 \\n2018 \\n2019 \\n2020 \\nCard-based Readers \\n 810  \\n 871  \\n 939  \\n 908  \\nBiometric Readers \\n 802  \\n 878  \\n 961  \\n 944  \\nMulti-technology Readers \\n 300  \\n 320  \\n 343  \\n 329  \\nElectronic Locks \\n 345  \\n 373  \\n 405  \\n 393  \\nControllers \\n 826  \\n 858  \\n 893  \\n 833  \\nOthers \\n 334  \\n 345  \\n 358  \\n 332  \\nTotal  \\n 3,416  \\n 3,646  \\n 3,899  \\n 3,740  \\nNote: “Others” includes RFID tags, door sets, keypads, and servers. \\nSource: Secondary Research, Expert Interviews, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n  TABLE 50 \\nPOST-COVID-19 COMMERCIAL ACCESS CONTROL MARKET, BY HARDWARE,  \\n2021–2026 (USD MILLION) \\nHardware  \\n2021 \\n2022 \\n2023 \\n2024 \\n2025 \\n2026 \\nCAGR \\n(2021–2026) \\nCard-based Readers \\n 958  \\n 1,029  \\n 1,103  \\n 1,179  \\n 1,255  \\n 1,330  \\n6.8% \\nBiometric Readers \\n 1,012  \\n 1,102  \\n 1,198  \\n 1,299  \\n 1,401  \\n 1,505  \\n8.3% \\nMulti-technology Readers \\n 345  \\n 368  \\n 392  \\n 416  \\n 440  \\n 464  \\n6.1% \\nElectronic Locks \\n 417  \\n 450  \\n 485  \\n 521  \\n 557  \\n 593  \\n7.3% \\nControllers \\n 848  \\n 877  \\n 905  \\n 930  \\n 951  \\n 968  \\n2.7% \\nOthers \\n 336  \\n 345  \\n 354  \\n 361  \\n 366  \\n 370  \\n2.0% \\nTotal  \\n 3,916  \\n 4,171  \\n 4,436  \\n 4,705  \\n 4,971  \\n 5,230  \\n6.0% \\nSource: Secondary Research, Expert Interviews, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n  TABLE 51 \\nPRE-COVID-19 COMMERCIAL ACCESS CONTROL MARKET, BY HARDWARE,  \\n2021–2026 (USD MILLION) \\nHardware  \\n2021 \\n2022 \\n2023 \\n2024 \\n2025 \\n2026 \\nCAGR \\n(2021–2026) \\nCard-based Readers \\n 1,079  \\n 1,154  \\n 1,230  \\n 1,309  \\n 1,388  \\n 1,468  \\n6.3% \\nBiometric Readers \\n 1,139  \\n 1,236  \\n 1,337  \\n 1,442  \\n 1,550  \\n 1,660  \\n7.8% \\nMulti-technology Readers \\n 389  \\n 413  \\n 437  \\n 462  \\n 487  \\n 512  \\n5.6% \\nElectronic Locks \\n 470  \\n 505  \\n 541  \\n 578  \\n 616  \\n 655  \\n6.9% \\nControllers \\n 955  \\n 984  \\n 1,010  \\n 1,033  \\n 1,052  \\n 1,068  \\n2.3% \\nOthers \\n 378  \\n 387  \\n 395  \\n 401  \\n 405  \\n 408  \\n1.5% \\nTotal  \\n 4,411  \\n 4,678  \\n 4,950  \\n 5,224  \\n 5,499  \\n 5,770  \\n5.5% \\nSource: Secondary Research, Expert Interviews, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n95 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n  TABLE 52 \\nCOMMERCIAL ACCESS CONTROL HARDWARE MARKET, BY REGION,  \\n2017–2020 (USD MILLION) \\nRegion  \\n2017 \\n2018 \\n2019 \\n2020 \\nNorth America  \\n 2,373  \\n 2,508  \\n 2,678  \\n 2,537  \\nEurope  \\n 1,698  \\n 1,836  \\n 1,942  \\n 1,825  \\nAPAC  \\n 1,524  \\n 1,703  \\n 1,910  \\n 1,899  \\nRoW  \\n 560  \\n 586  \\n 632  \\n 607  \\nTotal  \\n 6,155  \\n 6,633  \\n 7,162  \\n 6,868  \\nSource: Secondary Research, Expert Interviews, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n  TABLE 53 \\nPOST-COVID-19 COMMERCIAL ACCESS CONTROL HARDWARE MARKET, BY REGION, \\n2021–2026 (USD MILLION) \\nRegion \\n2021 \\n2022 \\n2023 \\n2024 \\n2025 \\n2026 \\nCAGR \\n(2021–2026) \\n North America  \\n 2,665  \\n 2,849  \\n 3,043  \\n 3,241  \\n 3,440  \\n 3,635  \\n6.4% \\nEurope  \\n 1,899  \\n 2,009  \\n 2,123  \\n 2,237  \\n 2,347  \\n 2,452  \\n5.2% \\nAPAC  \\n 2,089  \\n 2,334  \\n 2,602  \\n 2,890  \\n 3,194  \\n 3,512  \\n11.0% \\nRoW  \\n 644  \\n 695  \\n 749  \\n 806  \\n 863  \\n 921  \\n7.4% \\nTotal  \\n 7,296  \\n 7,888  \\n 8,517  \\n 9,174  \\n 9,844  \\n 10,520  \\n7.6% \\nSource: Secondary Research, Expert Interviews, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n  TABLE 54 \\nPRE-COVID-19 COMMERCIAL ACCESS CONTROL HARDWARE MARKET, BY REGION, \\n2021–2026 (USD MILLION) \\nRegion \\n2021 \\n2022 \\n2023 \\n2024 \\n2025 \\n2026 \\nCAGR \\n(2021–2026) \\nNorth America  \\n 3,130  \\n 3,317  \\n 3,507  \\n 3,699  \\n 3,891  \\n 4,080  \\n5.4% \\nEurope  \\n 2,235  \\n 2,350  \\n 2,463  \\n 2,575  \\n 2,684  \\n 2,789  \\n4.5% \\nAPAC  \\n 2,197  \\n 2,438  \\n 2,694  \\n 2,967  \\n 3,257  \\n 3,559  \\n10.1% \\nRoW  \\n 699  \\n 745  \\n 793  \\n 842  \\n 891  \\n 941  \\n6.1% \\nTotal  \\n 8,261  \\n 8,850  \\n 9,458  \\n 10,083  \\n 10,724  \\n 11,369  \\n6.6% \\nSource: Secondary Research, Expert Interviews, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\nCard-based readers are proven to be more reliable than biometric readers and electronic locks. Increasing \\nrequirement for smart and proximity cards to monitor and record employee activities is one of the factors \\ndriving the growth of the market for card-based readers. Johnson Controls provides card readers and \\ncontrollers for various commercial, industrial, and government applications.  \\nBiometric readers are rapidly gaining traction worldwide owing to the growing need for security and \\nsurveillance in the private and business sectors. The adoption of voice recognition systems in BFSI is \\nexpected to fuel the growth of the market for biometric readers in the coming years.  \\n \\n \\n \\n96 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n7.4.2 \\nCARD-BASED READERS \\nCards are used as credentials to authenticate users’ identities and determine access grant/denial (also \\nthe appropriate level of access). Access control readers can be magnetic stripes and proximity or smart \\ncard readers.  \\nSmart cards are proven to be more reliable than magnetic stripes and proximity cards. Increasing use of \\nsmart cards to monitor and record employee activities in organizations is one of the major factors driving \\nthe growth of the market for smart card readers.  \\nTo ensure enhanced security, magnetic stripes are replaced with proximity and smart card readers. Smart \\ncards and readers are likely to account for the largest market share, primarily due to the rising demand for \\ncontactless smart cards and readers.  \\nSmart cards are proven to be more reliable than magnetic stripe cards and proximity cards. By 2025, \\nsmart card readers are expected to surpass proximity card readers because of rapid technological \\ndevelopments and large-scale manufacturing of smart card readers. \\n7.4.2.1 \\nMagnetic stripe cards and readers  \\nA magnetic stripe card or a card is a plastic card with a magnetic stripe that stores data. A magnetic stripe \\ncard reads the information stored on the magnetic stripe of a card and transmits it to an access control \\nunit. However, the information can be easily stolen and duplicated. Magnetic stripe cards and readers have \\nminimal security as the data stored on a magnetic stripe card or a reader can be easily read. Also, \\nmagnetic stripe cards store only a limited volume of data (~2 kB), and they support minimal functionality.  \\n7.4.2.2 \\nProximity cards and readers \\nA proximity card or a reader is a contactless card that contains programmed data and operates on RFID \\ntechnology at the frequency of 125 kHz. Such a card consists of a coiled antenna and chips and holds \\nspecific numerical programming. The card carries a set of binary numbers that are converted by a reader \\ninto a protocol and transmitted to an access control panel for authentication. Proximity cards and readers \\ncommunicate through interface technologies such as RS232, RS485, Ethernet, and 24- or 32-bit Wiegand. \\n7.4.2.3 \\nSmart cards and readers \\nAccess to infrastructure can be electronically controlled by smart cards and readers. Smart cards are \\nembedded with microprocessors and memory modules and are classified into 2 types—contact and \\ncontactless smart cards. Contact smart cards have 8 contact points and are inserted into a smart card \\nreader for authentication. These smart cards are used for physical access control in applications wherein \\nthe transaction speed is not important—for example, parking. Contactless smart cards have embedded \\nantennas that enable communication with readers without any physical contact; these cards use radio-\\nbased technology to transfer data. Typically, smart card readers do not make access decisions but send \\ncard data to access control panels that verify the data against access lists.  \\nSmart card readers operate at a frequency of 13.56 MHz and follow the ISO 14443 standard. These cards \\nsecurely manage, store, and provide access to data. The data or information stored in a smart card is read \\nby a reader that is typically a part of a computer system. Smart cards provide better convenience and \\ntransaction security than magnetic stripe cards and proximity cards. Smart cards, also known as integrated \\ncircuit cards or chip cards, are supported by embedded integrated circuit chips that can be used for data \\nstorage, authentication, identification, and application processing. Readers can process data imprinted on \\nsmart cards either through direct contact (contact smart cards) or without contact (contactless smart \\ncards) through near-field communication (NFC) systems. Smart cards have several application areas, \\nincluding identification, health cards, public transit, ATM cards, credit cards, fuel cards, and security \\ntokens. Major players that offer smart cards include Samsung (South Korea), Fujitsu (Japan), Infineon \\n(Germany), and NXP (Netherlands). \\n \\n97 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\nContact smart cards can operate without a battery; power is supplied through the card reader. Contact \\nsmart cards are required to make physical contact with the card reader. While inserting the contact smart \\ncard through the reader, electronic contact is made between the card and the reader, and the data is \\nfetched and processed. Contact smart cards can be used for a single function or multiple functions. \\nContact smart cards find applications in credit and debit cards, fuel cards, health cards, and direct-to-home \\n(DTH) smart cards, among many others. Contactless smart cards operate without any direct physical \\ncontact with card readers; the data is exchanged between the card and reader via electromagnetic or \\nmagnetic fields. An antenna is embedded inside a contactless smart card, which enables communication \\nbetween the card and the reader. Contactless smart cards are increasingly being used in the retail industry \\nfor faster payments and automatic access applications as they require lesser processing time than that of \\ncontact smart cards. \\n7.4.3 \\nBIOMETRIC READERS \\nBiometric technologies are used to measure different physiological parameters for identification and \\nauthentication purposes in access control systems. Authentication by biometric verification has become \\nincreasingly popular in a wide range of applications. Biometric devices consist of a reader and software \\nthat convert the scanned information into digital format and a database that stores the biometric data for \\ncomparison. Each person has a unique overall pattern that cannot be duplicated. This makes biometrics a \\npopular method of authentication. Biometrics is one of the fastest-growing technologies used to secure \\nperimeters. This technology enables identifying a person’s physical characteristics to provide controlled \\nphysical access to infrastructure. This technology is being increasingly used in government facilities, \\nmanufacturing units, power stations, defense establishments, and enterprises.  \\nThe market for biometric reader-based access control systems has been further categorized into fingerprint \\nrecognition, palm recognition, iris recognition, face recognition, and voice recognition. The increasing use \\nof several types of biometric systems for identification applications at hospitals, organizations, government \\ninstitutions, educational facilities, etc., is fueling the growth of the biometric access control system market. \\nKey players in the biometric reader market include NEC Corporation (Japan), Thales Group (France), \\nJohnson Controls International plc (Ireland), Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (US), and IDEMIA (France). \\nIn biometrics, fingerprint recognition is most commonly used as it is one of the oldest, easy-to-install, and \\nlow-cost technologies. Fingerprint readers provide a high level of security; hence, they are widely used in \\ngovernment, BFSI, and healthcare verticals. Face recognition is also an advanced technology in terms of \\nsecurity features. It takes 2 to 3 facial features to identify an individual; hence, it is difficult to copy. \\nTherefore, the adoption of face recognition technology is expected to be high in the access control market.  \\nThe growing adoption of facial recognition solutions to enhance physical safety measures and control \\nunauthorized access to assets or locations is expected to foster the growth of the market for face \\nrecognition systems. Major manufacturers of face recognition readers include IDEMIA (France), Stonelock \\nGlobal (US), and Thales Group (France). The Federal Aviation Administration (US) uses face scan, voice \\nprint, fingerprint, hand geometry, and iris scan for increasing aviation security in the US; the United States \\nImmigration and Naturalization Service uses hand geometry and voice print to ensure improved security at \\nborder crossing points; and the Office of Legislative Counsel, House of Representatives (US), uses an iris \\nscanner to secure sensitive documents. \\n7.4.3.1 \\nFingerprint recognition \\nFingerprint recognition is an effective and simple method for identifying and authenticating individuals. \\nEvery person has unique fingerprints, which are a series of minutiae points, furrows, and ridges. There are \\n2 categories of fingerprint matching—minutiae-based and pattern-based. Minutiae points are important for \\nfinding and calculating the matching points with the fingerprint of a person. Pattern-based algorithms \\ncompare the basic fingerprint patterns (arch, whorl, and loop) of a person with stored templates. \\nFingerprint recognition is also used in police investigations, defense-related purposes, and immigration \\napplications. \\n \\n98 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\nFingerprint scanners are widely used in organizations as a method of employee identification. These \\nscanners are also installed on mobile phones and laptops to authenticate users. The increasing adoption \\nof automated fingerprint identification systems (AFIS) is expected to fuel the growth of the market for \\nfingerprint recognition solutions. 3 types of fingerprint scanners—capacitive, sweep, and optical—are used \\nin access control systems. Optical scanners are preferred for no-contact and hygienic applications. ASSA \\nABLOY AB (Sweden), Suprema HQ Inc. (South Korea), IDEMIA (France), Thales Group (France), and \\nSecuGen Corporation (US) are the major biometric reader manufacturers. \\nAfter the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, users worldwide are avoiding the use of fingerprint \\nscanners. For instance, hundreds of businesses in Hyderabad (India) have stopped using fingerprint-based \\naccess control systems after orders from state government authorities. Similarly, there have been other \\ncountries or cities wherein the use of fingerprint systems has either been limited or stopped—for example, \\nSchenectady (New York), Oman (Middle East), and Mumbai (India). As a result, the demand for fingerprint-\\nbased biometric systems is likely to decrease in the coming years. \\n7.4.3.2 \\nPalm recognition  \\nPalm recognition technology-based biometric products measure hand geometry—the size of the palm, \\nlength and width of fingers, the distance between knuckles—to authenticate user identity and grant access. \\nAll biometric techniques differ based on the security level, user acceptance, cost, and performance. Palm \\nprint matching techniques are of 3 types—minutiae-, correlation-, and ridge-based. \\nMinutiae-based palm print matching is similar to fingerprint matching—it relies on the minutiae points. \\nCorrelation-based matching involves superimposing palm images and comparing the ridges. Ridge-based \\nmatching relies on ridge pattern landmark features such as sweat pores, spatial attributes, and geometric \\ncharacteristics or local texture analysis. This method overcomes some of the difficulties associated with \\nextracting minutiae from low-quality images. Palm recognition-based biometric screening is considered to \\nprovide a medium level of security compared to other techniques. COVID-19 has led to a fall in demand for \\ntouch-based biometric systems, which will have a significant and long-term impact on the manufacturers, \\ndistributors, and customers of biometric solutions, causing a drop in revenue of fingerprint sensor vendors. \\n7.4.3.3 \\nIris recognition \\nBiometric iris recognition systems record the unique patterns in the colored circle of a person’s eye to \\nverify and authenticate identity. Iris recognition technology is one of the most accurate and fastest \\ntechnologies; additionally, it can operate on long distances. In this recognition method, an “iris code” is \\ngenerated on the basis of iris texture, and this code is unique for every individual. Iris scanners use the \\nmathematical pattern-recognition technique from the video image of one or both the irises of an \\nindividual’s eyes. Irises have complex patterns, and they are unique and stable. Iris recognition algorithm \\nidentifies more than 200 identification points, including rings, furrows, and freckles within an iris. Irises are \\nmore detail oriented, thereby providing a high level of security. \\nVendors of contactless access control systems, including iris recognition, are forced to adapt to the threat \\nof COVID-19 as there has been a sudden spike in demand for iris recognition devices. To curtail the spread \\nof the coronavirus, worldwide authorities are reducing the use of contact-heavy biometrics programs, \\nleading to a rise in demand for contactless biometric systems, such as iris recognition.  \\n7.4.3.4 \\nFacial recognition  \\nFace recognition is a software application that can identify an individual by comparing and analyzing \\npatterns in a digital image. It is used for surveillance and security purposes. Facial recognition systems use \\nnumeric codes called face prints. These systems identify and use nodal points on a human face to \\nmeasure variables such as the width of the nose, eyes, and cheekbones. To achieve more accuracy, 3D \\nrecognition systems are being used. 3D face readers use 3D sensors to capture information, which is then \\nused for recognizing distinctive facial features such as the contour of eye sockets, nose, and chin.  \\n \\n99 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\nThere are different matching modes available through facial recognition readers, such as one-to-many or \\n“identification” (1:N), one-to-one or “verification” (1:1), and 1:few segmented “identification” (1:Few). Most \\naccess control systems use 1:1 matching. 1:1 biometric “verification” matching authenticates an \\nindividual’s identity by comparing a captured biometric template with a biometric template pre-stored in a \\ndatabase. Face recognition readers read the global, local, individual data point-based features to recognize \\nan individual. The global data set includes graph mesh, while local points include groups of reference \\npoints and individual characteristic points. The result is a face print used to compare captured images. \\nSimilar to iris recognition devices, face recognition access control devices are also expected to witness a \\nrise in demand. Vendors of face recognition technology-based access control systems have started \\nproviding additional features, such as retrofitting new software to screen and detecting individuals not \\nwearing protective masks.  \\n7.4.3.5 \\nVoice recognition \\nVoice recognition is a non-contact, nonintrusive, and easy-to-use biometrics technology. It is a method of \\nidentifying and authenticating an individual’s vocal modalities. This technology uses audio capturing \\ndevices to record voice data at the time of enrolment and then extracts unique features from the data to \\ncreate a template for future identification and verification. Voice recognition technology is the only solution \\nthat can provide remote authentication. It is ideal for situations where distant verification is required, such \\nas telephone-based transactions. Voice recognition applications include account access to financial \\nservices, customer authentication for service calls, monitoring offenders under house arrest by making \\nrandom calls, and voice mining surveillance in intercepted phone calls. \\n7.4.4 \\nMULTI-TECHNOLOGY READERS \\nMulti-technology readers employ both card and biometrics. Multi-technology readers provide a multi-\\nprotocol, multi-frequency solution; they can read multiple 13.56-MHz smart cards, MIFARE-encrypted \\nsectors, and 125-kHz proximity cards. Multi-technology readers provide a way to transition from proximity \\ncards or magnetic stripes to smart cards. Major providers of multi-technology readers include ASSA ABLOY \\nAB (Sweden), Allegion Plc (Ireland), IDEMIA (France), and Johnson Controls International Plc (Ireland). \\n7.4.5 \\nELECTRONIC LOCKS \\nAn electronic lock is a locking device that operates on electricity. It can be standalone or can be integrated \\nwith access control systems. Key advantages of electronic locks include the key control, addition of keys \\nwithout altering the lock cylinder, ease of access control, transaction logging, and remote operation. There \\nare 3 types of electronic locks—electromagnetic locks, electric strikes, and wireless locks.  \\nElectronic locks provide better security compared to mechanical locks. Electronic mechanisms and access \\nmethods provide additional security as these systems cannot be tampered with. Electronic locks can be \\ncombined with biometric authentication systems, such as fingerprint scanning. The rapid adoption of the \\nelectronic access control system is a key factor for the growth of the market for different types of electronic \\nlocks. As a result, electronic locks are rapidly replacing mechanical locks across the world. ASSA ABLOY AB \\n(Sweden) is one of the global players providing locks and integrated software.  \\nCurrently available electronic locks come with advanced technologies such as RFID, keypads, biometrics \\n(fingerprint), touchscreen panels, and Bluetooth. \\nElectromagnetic locks include large electromagnets mounted on door frames and attached armature \\nmounted on doors. Magnetic locks are simple to install and are attack resistant. These locks are engaged \\nby powering them with electricity and require a constant supply of electricity to remain locked. \\nElectric strikes, also known as electric latches, replace standard strikes mounted on door frames. Electric \\nstrikes can be the simplest to install when they are designed for one-for-one drop-in replacement of a \\nstandard strike, but for some electric strike designs, the door frame needs to be heavily modified. \\n \\n100 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\nWireless locks or smart locks are electromechanical locking systems that can be operated through \\nauthorized connected devices such as smartphones and tablets. Smart locks perform the function of \\nlocking and unlocking after receiving instructions from authorized devices through a wireless \\ncommunications protocol. The wireless communications protocol is a digital description that sets the rule \\nfor the transfer of data between devices. Wireless locks are inbuilt with any of the following wireless \\ntechnologies: Bluetooth, Zigbee, and Zwave. The benefits of smart locks over traditional locks include easy \\nconnectivity, high security, high convenience, and full access controls. These lock systems allow users to \\ngo keyless and lock or unlock their assets with smartphones, tablets, or similar devices. However, the \\nbatteries of these devices need regular monitoring and timely replacement to avoid dysfunction. \\n7.4.6 \\nCONTROLLERS \\nThe access controller or control panel is the main part of an access control system. Control panels have \\nvarious options that are configured according to customer requirements. Control panels transmit data \\nbetween readers and software through various types of communication interfaces, including Wiegand, \\nRS232, RS 485, and TCP/IP. The controller receives the credentials from the reader and compares them \\nwith the rules configured for the access card, and accordingly, access is granted or denied. All controllers \\nhave common features, including a graphical user interface for configuring and management of access \\ncontrol systems, report generation to communicate between different departments of an organization, \\nalarm notifications such as message or email, allowing multiple access credentials and modes, and \\nenabling each credential only once with the anti-passback feature.  \\nBased on the operational technology, there are 2 main types of controllers—serial access controllers and IP \\naccess controllers.  \\n7.4.7 \\nOTHERS \\nOthers mainly include RFID tags, keypads, door sets, and servers. A server is used as a storage and \\ncommunication device for access control readers and entrance systems, such as turnstiles or door \\ncontacts. The access control server serves as the central database and file manager for recording system \\nactivity and distributing information to and from access controllers. Access control keypads are devices \\nthat are used in the place of card readers. This device has numeric keys for entering codes. When access \\ncontrol keypads are used in conjunction with card readers, a valid card and a correct code are required for \\ngranting access. RFID tags include key fobs, wristbands, ISO cards, clamshell cards, and vehicle mount \\ntags. These tags are widely used for secure access, people tracking, and vehicle access applications.  \\n7.5 \\nENTRANCE CONTROL SYSTEMS \\n7.5.1 \\nMARKET FOR ENTRANCE CONTROL SYSTEMS FOR PEDESTRIANS IN \\nAPAC TO GROW AT HIGHEST CAGR DURING FORECAST PERIOD \\nThe entrance control system is designed to secure large commercial buildings, corporate offices, shopping \\nmalls, and government offices. The entrance control system, for instance, a biometric system, protects the \\ncompany’s database, private client data, and server rooms. Building residents/employees expect security \\nactions to be taken to protect their safety. Also, though a building has security guards present at the \\nentrance, intruders can slip in unobserved when the guards are busy manually checking IDs. Hence, it is \\nabsolutely crucial to have entrance control systems. There are many entrance control systems designed by \\nindustry players.

Along with it, an increase in fire \\nprotection-related expenditure of various enterprises, rise in fire-related deaths, and stringent \\ngovernmental norms are also driving the market for fire analysis software. \\n8.2.2 \\nFIRE MAPPING AND ANALYSIS SOFTWARE \\nFire protection systems demand real-time information and analysis of the situation to allocate resources \\nproperly for minimal damage. Fire mapping and analysis software provide an interactive map display with a \\nreal-time system for decision makers to efficiently and quickly make decisions during fire-related \\nsituations. Mapping helps provide a spatial representation of data, presenting groupings and associations \\nthat are not clear in a standard data view. Users can merge emergency equipment, boundaries, and \\ntopographic data into one display on the map for an immediate snapshot of all the resources in a specific \\nregion. Companies such as FireRescue1 and The Omega Group provide fire mapping and analysis \\nsoftware.  \\n8.2.3 \\nFIRE MODELING AND SIMULATION SOFTWARE \\nFire protection systems or processes require trained and well-informed fire units. Unit members need to \\nhave knowledge and experience to fight in these kinds of disasters. In such cases, fire modeling and \\nsimulation software prove to be a useful platform. Such software use spatial data and visualize it in a \\nversatile graphical interface. They are used by agencies to train firefighters. They provide command and \\nstaff trainers, scenario and image generators, and operator stations for role players and instructors, \\ndynamic terrain servers, situational awareness stations, and unmanned vehicle controller stations. Several \\nmodeling and simulation software are being developed in the market—e.g., Consolidated Model of Fire and \\nSmoke Transport (CFAST), developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). \\nAutodesk Inc. and Harrington Group Inc. also provide fire modeling and simulation software. \\n8.3 \\nVIDEO SURVEILLANCE SOFTWARE  \\n8.3.1 \\nRISING TRENDS OF DEEP LEARNING AND AI TO DRIVE MARKET \\nGROWTH  \\nThe video surveillance market for software is broadly classified into video management software (VMS) and \\nvideo analytics or intelligent video surveillance (IVS).  \\n  TABLE 67 \\nCOMMERCIAL VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SOFTWARE MARKET, BY OFFERING,  \\n2017–2020 (USD BILLION) \\nOffering \\n2017 \\n2018 \\n2019 \\n2020 \\nVideo Analytics \\n 2.3  \\n 2.8  \\n 3.2  \\n 3.2  \\nVideo Management System \\n 3.4  \\n 4.0  \\n 4.5  \\n 4.4  \\nTotal  \\n 5.6  \\n 6.7  \\n 7.6  \\n 7.7  \\nSource: Secondary Literature, Annual Reports, Press Releases, Journals, Industry News, Organizations, Associations, White Papers, \\nExpert Interviews, Blogs, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n108 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n  TABLE 68 \\nPOST-COVID-19 COMMERCIAL VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SOFTWARE MARKET, BY OFFERING, \\n2021–2026 (USD BILLION) \\nOffering \\n2021 \\n2022 \\n2023 \\n2024 \\n2025 \\n2026 \\nCAGR \\n(2021–2026) \\nVideo Analytics \\n 3.7  \\n 4.4  \\n 5.1  \\n 6.0  \\n 7.1  \\n 8.2  \\n17.3% \\nVideo Management System \\n 4.9  \\n 5.7  \\n 6.5  \\n 7.5  \\n 8.5  \\n 9.7  \\n14.5% \\nTotal  \\n 8.6  \\n 10.0  \\n 11.7  \\n 13.5  \\n 15.6  \\n 17.9  \\n15.7% \\nSource: Secondary Literature, Annual Reports, Press Releases, Journals, Industry News, Organizations, Associations, White Papers, \\nExpert Interviews, Blogs, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n  TABLE 69 \\nPRE-COVID-19 COMMERCIAL VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SOFTWARE MARKET, BY OFFERING, \\n2021–2026 (USD BILLION) \\nOffering \\n2021 \\n2022 \\n2023 \\n2024 \\n2025 \\n2026 \\nCAGR \\n(2021–2026) \\nVideo Analytics \\n 4.3  \\n 5.0  \\n 5.7  \\n 6.5  \\n 7.4  \\n 8.4  \\n14.4% \\nVideo Management System \\n 5.7  \\n 6.5  \\n 7.2  \\n 8.1  \\n 9.0  \\n 9.9  \\n11.6% \\nTotal  \\n 10.0  \\n 11.4  \\n 12.9  \\n 14.6  \\n 16.4  \\n 18.3  \\n12.8% \\nSource: Secondary Literature, Annual Reports, Press Releases, Journals, Industry News, Organizations, Associations, White Papers, \\nExpert Interviews, Blogs, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n  TABLE 70 \\nCOMMERCIAL VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SOFTWARE MARKET, BY REGION,  \\n2017–2020 (USD MILLION) \\nRegion  \\n2017 \\n2018 \\n2019 \\n2020 \\nNorth America  \\n 1,733  \\n 2,033  \\n 2,284  \\n 2,268  \\nEurope  \\n 1,125  \\n 1,307  \\n 1,453  \\n 1,430  \\nAPAC  \\n 2,362  \\n 2,882  \\n 3,364  \\n 3,433  \\nRoW  \\n 424  \\n 491  \\n 545  \\n 526  \\nTotal  \\n 5,644  \\n 6,713  \\n 7,646  \\n 7,658  \\nSource: Secondary Literature, Annual Reports, Press Releases, Journals, Industry News, Organizations, Associations, White Papers, \\nExpert Interviews, Blogs, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n  TABLE 71 \\nPOST-COVID-19 COMMERCIAL VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SOFTWARE MARKET, BY REGION, \\n2021–2026 (USD MILLION) \\nRegion \\n2021 \\n2022 \\n2023 \\n2024 \\n2025 \\n2026 \\nCAGR \\n(2021–2026) \\nNorth America  \\n 2,518  \\n 2,880  \\n 3,296  \\n 3,764  \\n 4,279  \\n 4,836  \\n13.5% \\nEurope  \\n 1,571  \\n 1,777  \\n 2,011  \\n 2,268  \\n 2,547  \\n 2,841  \\n12.2% \\nAPAC  \\n 3,965  \\n 4,714  \\n 5,609  \\n 6,655  \\n 7,861  \\n 9,228  \\n18.0% \\nRoW  \\n 577  \\n 650  \\n 734  \\n 826  \\n 924  \\n 1,028  \\n11.9% \\nTotal  \\n 8,631  \\n 10,021  \\n 11,650  \\n 13,513  \\n 15,612  \\n 17,933  \\n15.3% \\nSource: Secondary Literature, Annual Reports, Press Releases, Journals, Industry News, Organizations, Associations, White Papers, \\nExpert Interviews, Blogs, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n109 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n  TABLE 72 \\nPRE-COVID-19 COMMERCIAL VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SOFTWARE MARKET, BY REGION, \\n2021–2026 (USD MILLION) \\nRegion \\n2021 \\n2022 \\n2023 \\n2024 \\n2025 \\n2026 \\nCAGR \\n(2021–2026) \\nNorth America  \\n 2,908  \\n 3,256  \\n 3,628  \\n 4,030  \\n 4,455  \\n 4,908  \\n11.5% \\nEurope  \\n 1,812  \\n 2,006  \\n 2,209  \\n 2,424  \\n 2,646  \\n 2,877  \\n10.2% \\nAPAC  \\n 4,638  \\n 5,398  \\n 6,254  \\n 7,217  \\n 8,290  \\n 9,487  \\n15.9% \\nRoW  \\n 677  \\n 748  \\n 822  \\n 900  \\n 980  \\n 1,063  \\n9.9% \\nTotal  \\n 10,035  \\n 11,408  \\n 12,914  \\n 14,571  \\n 16,371  \\n 18,335  \\n13.2% \\nSource: Secondary Literature, Annual Reports, Press Releases, Journals, Industry News, Organizations, Associations, White Papers, \\nExpert Interviews, Blogs, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\nVMS is an essential part of any surveillance system.

Cameras can provide a wide-ranging view, \\nbut they add very little value in analyzing the activities. To address this problem, the Video Content Analysis \\n(VCA) solution was developed. This solution is today referred to as video analytics and is primarily used in \\ncorporate or government systems, requiring powerful servers to run each application, along with high-end \\ninfrastructure.  \\nVideo analytics enhances video surveillance systems by performing the tasks of real-time event detection, \\npost-event analysis, and extraction of statistical data while saving manpower costs and increasing the \\neffectiveness of the surveillance system operation. Video analytics algorithms may be implemented to \\nanalyze recorded video, a task that is challenging and time-consuming for a human operator, especially in \\ncases where several videos must be reviewed. Through the rapid analysis of a recorded video, video \\nanalytics can pinpoint an event in the recorded video and retrieve the relevant video segment from the \\nstored video. \\nVideo analytics can be used for motion detection, facial recognition, license plate recognition, people \\ncounting and dwell time monitoring, and recognizing long checkout lines, as well as for sending alerts. \\n8.3.3 \\nVIDEO MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE  \\nVMS, also known as a video management system or video management server, acts as a base for video \\nmonitoring, recording, and analyzing. Various types of software are available depending on the requirement \\nof customers.  \\nVideo management software runs on Windows or Unix/Linux and offers live viewing, storing, and retrieving \\nof video from multiple cameras. The systems installed at multiple sites and locations must be \\nsynchronized. Memory allocation is done automatically, and if the storage capacity is full, an alert message \\nis sent through an e-mail. The system works with minimal external assistance, thus reducing operational \\ncosts.  \\n \\n110 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\nVMS is used in applications requiring several cameras to be monitored at the same time. IP-based video \\nsurveillance systems were adopted prior to the development of the VMS software. In an IP (network video) \\nsystem, cameras are connected to the standard computer Ethernet network such as LAN, WAN, or the \\ninternet. The video is stored on a central computer server/PC or network-attached storage (NAS) unit. \\nTherefore, a VMS is required to access and handle the videos. The VMS software can be installed on a \\nseparate PC or on the same PC. As today’s cameras feature in-built VMS software, users only need \\nsmartphone/tablet apps to view live and recorded videos.  \\n8.3.4 \\nSOFTWARE BY DEPLOYMENT MODE \\n8.3.4.1 \\nOn-premises \\nOn-premises VMS solutions are installed at the end user’s premises. They come with a high installation \\ncost; the installation process includes the installation of OS, configuration, setting up storage servers, and \\ninstalling the VMS application. The on-premises deployment supports a wide range of analog and IP \\ncameras. On-premises VMS solutions offer customization, upgrades, integration, and security. Other \\nbenefits to the end user include scalability, reliability, flexibility, and remote location access. Government, \\nairport, banking, and manufacturing verticals prefer on-premises deployment owing to its security, \\ncompliance, and scalability features. \\n8.3.4.2 \\nCloud \\nIn cloud implementation, VMS solutions are accessed via the internet and hosted by third-party VMS \\nproviders. The video recording, controlling, and video management is performed by the cloud. Cloud-based \\nVMS solutions are more in demand due to their scalability, lower CAPEX, and pay-as-you-go models; they \\nare cost effective and mostly deployed by SMEs. Cloud-based VMS solutions have several benefits, such as \\nno requirement for on-site servers, rapid deployment of solutions without configuration, and easy access \\nthrough the internet. Cloud-based VMS solutions have been largely adopted by retail, small offices, and \\nlogistics users. \\n8.4 \\nACCESS CONTROL SOFTWARE  \\n8.4.1 \\nCOMPANIES OFFERING SOFTWARE WITH OPEN ARCHITECTURE  \\nTO COMBINE SECURITY EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE INTO SINGLE \\nPLATFORM \\nThe access control market for software offerings is broadly classified into visitor management systems and \\nothers, which includes databases, analytics tools, and software tools. Several companies are offering \\nsoftware with an open architecture to combine security equipment and software into a single security \\nmanagement platform and follow international standards for networking and integration. Biometric devices \\nare also implementing software development toolkits (SDK) and programming algorithms to identify \\nobjects and people.  \\nThe database is used for storing the data fetched from access control readers and electronic locks. In large \\norganizations, access control software is integrated with other security management platforms, such as \\nvideo surveillance, intrusion, and visitor management systems. HID Global (US), AMAG Technology, Inc. \\n(US), Johnson Controls International Plc (Ireland), S2 Security Corporation (US), Lenel Systems \\nInternational, Inc.

The service typically includes video recording, \\nstorage, remote viewing, management alerts, and cybersecurity. It is a combination of recording and \\nwatching images on monitors or mobile phones through data centers. VSaaS servers are installed in data \\ncenters and are used by security companies to offer Managed Video Software-as-a-Service (MVaaS). \\nVSaaS, popularly known as hosted and managed video surveillance, incorporates on-site storage, off-site \\nstorage, and remote video monitoring through a central station.  \\nVSaaS is a cloud-based surveillance system that allows the operator to remotely manage the recording, \\nstorage, viewing, and monitoring of a surveillance video from other locations. In VSaaS, cameras are \\ninstalled at various locations, and the video is streamed over the internet. These services are made \\navailable to users through the internet from a cloud computing server. As VSaaS is managed in the cloud, \\nthe operator can access the footage or cameras from anywhere, at any time through a desktop, laptop, or \\nmobile device. Cloud services are designed to provide scalable and easy access to applications or \\nresources. Cloud services include storage backup, hosted office suite, and database processing. VSaaS \\nfinds applications in government, city surveillance and infrastructure, banking, retail, transportation, \\neducation, and residential sectors. It is segmented into hosted, managed, and hybrid services. \\n9.5.2.1 \\nHosted  \\n9 . 5 . 2 . 1 . 1  \\nR i s i n g  a d o p t i o n  o f  c l o u d  s e r v i c e s  d r i v e s  g r o w t h  o f  h o s t e d  \\nV S a a S  m a r k e t  \\nHosted service is also termed as off-site or remote VSaaS. In hosted services, data is stored off-site at the \\nlocation of the security camera. The video generated on-site is transferred over a network to the service \\nprovider\\'s data center, where it is managed and stored. The video is either stored at the provider’s own \\ndata center or at a data center managed by a third party, such as Amazon or Microsoft Azure. Video data is \\ntransferred from the security camera to the data center over a wide area network (WAN). Hosted VSaaS is \\nthe most significant breakthrough in traditional video surveillance, and it has become the uniform form of \\ncloud services. Hosted VSaaS is expected to create opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises. \\nHowever, some system integrators are targeting larger enterprises. \\n9.5.2.2 \\nManaged  \\n9 . 5 . 2 . 2 . 1  \\nR e d u c e d  o p e r a t i o n a l  c o s t s  p r o v i d e  o p p o r t u n i t i e s  f o r   \\nm a n a g e d  V S a a S  \\nManaged VSaaS is referred to as cloud computing. It involves storing on-site video recordings at the \\ncustomer\\'s site, which is then remotely maintained, monitored, and managed by the service provider. \\nManaged VSaaS is where the customer has to pay for managing and viewing the video remotely. In some \\ncases, a video is also captured on a storage system at the user\\'s premises. Managed VSaaS simplifies \\nhardware-related issues and lowers the need to monitor manpower. \\n9.5.2.3 \\nHybrid \\n9 . 5 . 2 . 3 . 1  \\nE n s u r e  m o r e  d a t a  s e c u r i t y ,  r e m o t e  a c c e s s ,  f l e x i b i l i t y ,   \\na n d  s c a l a b i l i t y   \\nHybrid VSaaS is a combination of hosted and managed VSaaS.

With the rising demand for cloud- and IoT-based systems, \\nnumerous market players are integrating advanced technology-based physical access control systems. This \\nchapter describes the market for Access Control as a Service (ACaaS)—a cloud service platform for access \\ncontrol. The market for ACaaS has been subsegmented into hosted, managed, and hybrid services. The \\nACaaS market is dominated by HID Global (US), Johnson Controls International PLC (Ireland), dormakaba \\nHolding AG (Switzerland), Allegion Plc (Ireland), Stanley Security Solutions, Inc. (US), and Brivo, Inc. (US). \\nCloud computing has become the focus of attention in almost all industries; several enterprises and \\norganizations today outsource operational services and workflows to service providers who offer cloud-\\nbased services through a variety of service models, such as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a \\nService (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). ACaaS applies the principles of SaaS to access \\ncontrol. These services are built on an open-source platform. It removes the need to purchase expensive \\nsoftware and provides the freedom to pay based on consumption. ACaaS enables customers from small \\nand medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to pay for specific features according to their requirements.  \\n \\n129 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\nTraditional access control systems have some limitations, such as the software being compatible only with \\ncertain equipment, which compels users to purchase whatever the provider recommends. Consequently, \\ntraditional access control systems increase the cost of ownership as a user needs to purchase both \\nsoftware and hardware (which need periodic maintenance and upgrades). However, the ACaaS platform \\nassigns the right access to the right people in real time. Also, it can be deployed from 2 doors to as many \\nas the physical infrastructure can support. The major reasons behind the increasing adoption of ACaaS \\ninclude the growing use of mobile devices as authentication checkpoints and the increasing number of \\nconnected devices.  \\nBrivo, Inc. (US) and Cloudstructure, Inc. (US) are the leading providers of cloud-based access control and \\nvideo surveillance products for physical security and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. ACaaS providers \\noffer services based on the number of doors and schedule services at regular intervals (monthly or yearly). \\nTo capture the significant market share, Brivo, Inc. (US) has launched a digital credential solution called \\nthe Mobile Pass that locks/unlocks doors using a smartphone. The popularity of mobile credentials is \\nexpected to grow as mobile phones allow the convenience of not carrying any cards and updating any \\nexisting hardware. \\nDifferent types of hosted ACaaS software are maintained by the owner of the solutions; therefore, users \\nneed not pay for the maintenance of the servers. This has been the key driving factor for the growth of the \\nmarket for hosted services. The ability of a third party to update the access rights of the user saves the \\ntime and cost spent on monitoring and managing all access control activities. Also, users have to pay only \\nfor the opt-out services. The benefits offered by the hosted and managed services, such as reduced labor \\ncost and minimized capital expenditure, as well as the freedom given to companies to stay focused on core \\nbusiness areas, contribute most to the growth of the market for ACaaS. The demand for these services is \\nexpected to be driven by manufacturing & residential, government, healthcare, and commercial verticals. \\nThe market is evolving with new technologies constantly replacing traditional access control systems. Many \\ncompanies are introducing new technologies that can be integrated with access control systems and \\ndelivered as a service. \\n9.6.4.1 \\nHosted ACaaS \\nIn hosted services, the servers holding access control data are placed at third-party locations. A user \\nreceives complete control over the access rights but is exempted from maintaining the infrastructure. A \\nhosted ACaaS is enabled with online management of remote access and control. With hosted services, \\nmultiple facilities can be networked. As the solution is web-based, it does not require any client software \\nfor supporting access control systems and is nearly maintenance-free. \\nThe high rate of adoption of access control systems to ensure high safety and security and prevents \\nunauthorized individuals from gaining access to commercial and corporate infrastructure; this has been \\nthe major factor driving the demand for hosted services. The increased need to protect people and \\nproperties across the manufacturing plants of industries such as oil & gas, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, \\nmetal & mining, power, automotive, water treatment, cement, and textiles is expected to boost the growth \\nof the hosted ACaaS market. \\nThe growth of the market for hosted services is attributed to the rapid industrialization and increased \\nsecurity concerns in APAC countries. The high adoption of advanced mechanical and electronic security \\nservices has been the key driving factor for the market’s growth in North America.  \\n \\n \\n \\n130 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n9.6.4.2 \\nManaged ACaaS \\nIn managed ACaaS, a user pays a third party to administer the access control platform. The third party \\nmanages the services, including adding/deleting access rights, changing/assigning schedules, printing \\nbadges and credentials, and door ajar/propped monitoring. All the above third-party services are managed \\nby the servers located at the third-party location. Managed services are handled by third-party servers, \\nreducing the user’s burden of adding and deleting access rights. This is one of the key factors driving the \\nmarket for managed access control as a service market. \\nIn managed access control as a service, any kind of changes or updates done in the security system are \\ndone by the service provider. This benefit of the managed access control where everything is administered \\nby trained security professionals off-site is one of the key reasons driving market growth. \\n9.6.4.3 \\nHybrid ACaaS \\nHybrid ACaaS is a combination of both hosted and managed access control services. In this type of access \\ncontrol, a certain part of the access control system is handled by the user, while the remaining functions \\nare outsourced to a third party. In this model, access permissions are not associated directly with the \\nattributes or the roles.

Sea and inland ports are important transportation centers for \\ninternational goods trading. Huge container ships lay anchor, discharge their consignments, and go out for \\nnew cargos. Video cameras can be fixed across the port for monitoring all activities. Genetec Inc. (Canada) \\nand Seon (Canada) are providing security systems and solutions in the transportation sector. SecurEye, a \\nblast-resistant surveillance system, from Visual Defense Inc. (Canada), is used in the transportation sector \\nwith mobile and fixed installations in buses, trains, light rails, trolleys, and other vehicles or in stations, \\nplatforms tunnels, and bridges. This system monitors captured videos for the investigation of terrorist or \\ncriminal activities within the camera’s area of view. Biometric techniques are also used in the \\ntransportation sector. For instance, for identity confirmation of each driver, the biometric identity card is \\nissued. This type of ID card allows for tracking of lost or stolen properties by tying them to a geographical \\nposition and tying a vehicle to a specific driver. This not only reduces inventory loss but also maximizes car-\\ncarrying safety.  \\nAccess control systems play a critical role in air transport for providing security to passengers and staff and \\nalso ensure a smooth flow of passengers in airports. Other public transportation application areas for \\naccess control systems include ports, railway networks, terminals, and freight and distribution centers. \\nHowever, airport security has been of prime concern across the world, and it is imperative to undertake \\nvarious initiatives to safeguard these facilities from vulnerabilities; this has led to the wider adoption of \\naccess control systems at airports. \\n  TABLE 123 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET FOR TRANSPORTATION VERTICAL,  \\nBY OFFERING, 2017–2020 (USD BILLION) \\nOffering \\n2017 \\n2018 \\n2019 \\n2020 \\nHardware & Software  \\n 9.2  \\n 10.3  \\n 11.4  \\n 10.9  \\nService \\n 19.3  \\n 20.9  \\n 22.7  \\n 22.7  \\nTotal \\n 28.5  \\n 31.2  \\n 34.1  \\n 33.6  \\nSource: Secondary Literature, Expert Interview, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n  TABLE 124 \\nPOST-COVID-19 COMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET FOR TRANSPORTATION \\nVERTICAL, BY OFFERING, 2021–2026 (USD BILLION) \\nOffering \\n2021 \\n2022 \\n2023 \\n2024 \\n2025 \\n2026 \\nCAGR \\n(2021–2026) \\nHardware & Software  \\n 11.8  \\n 13.1  \\n 14.5  \\n 16.1  \\n 17.7  \\n 19.5  \\n10.6% \\nService \\n 24.5  \\n 26.7  \\n 29.1  \\n 31.6  \\n 34.3  \\n 37.1  \\n8.7% \\nTotal  \\n 36.2  \\n 39.7  \\n 43.6  \\n 47.7  \\n 52.1  \\n 56.6  \\n9.3% \\nSource: Secondary Literature, Expert Interview, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n140 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n  TABLE 125 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET FOR TRANSPORTATION VERTICAL, BY REGION, \\n2017–2020 (USD BILLION) \\nRegion  \\n2017 \\n2018 \\n2019 \\n2020 \\nNorth America  \\n 8.5  \\n 9.0  \\n 9.5  \\n 9.1  \\nEurope  \\n 5.4  \\n 5.8  \\n 6.2  \\n 5.9  \\nAPAC  \\n 12.0  \\n 13.6  \\n 15.4  \\n 15.7  \\nRoW  \\n 2.6  \\n 2.7  \\n 2.9  \\n 2.9  \\nTotal  \\n 28.5  \\n 31.2  \\n 34.1  \\n 33.6  \\nSource: Secondary Literature, Expert Interview, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\n  TABLE 126 \\nPOST-COVID-19 COMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET FOR TRANSPORTATION \\nVERTICAL, BY REGION, 2021–2026 (USD BILLION) \\nRegion \\n2021 \\n2022 \\n2023 \\n2024 \\n2025 \\n2026 \\nCAGR \\n(2021–2026) \\nNorth America  \\n 9.5  \\n 10.1  \\n 10.7  \\n 11.2  \\n 11.8  \\n 12.3  \\n5.3% \\nEurope  \\n 6.2  \\n 6.7  \\n 7.1  \\n 7.6  \\n 8.0  \\n 8.5  \\n6.3% \\nAPAC  \\n 17.5  \\n 19.7  \\n 22.3  \\n 25.2  \\n 28.3  \\n 31.7  \\n12.7% \\nRoW  \\n 3.0  \\n 3.2  \\n 3.5  \\n 3.7  \\n 3.9  \\n 4.1  \\n6.5% \\nTotal  \\n 36.2  \\n 39.7  \\n 43.6  \\n 47.7  \\n 52.1  \\n 56.6  \\n9.3% \\nSource: Secondary Literature, Expert Interview, and MarketsandMarkets Analysis \\n \\nWith the rise in crime, harassment, liability suits, vandalism-related and terrorism-related threats, the need \\nfor providing surveillance for the general transportation system has increased recently.

Access control is widely used in the military \\n& defense segment for applications such as protecting defense personnel, preventing theft and damage to \\nassets and infrastructure, and preventing unauthorized access to physical security zones. Biometrics has \\nproven to be one of the ground-breaking technologies for identification and verification. In April 2018, the \\nUS Army Research Laboratory developed an AI and machine learning technique that produces visible face \\nimages from thermal images captured in low-light conditions or at night. This technology aids in matching \\nthermal face images with the existing biometric face databases or watch lists that only contain visible face \\nimagery. Technologically advanced countries such as the US and the UK are using biometric technology to \\nassist in identifying detainees in war zones. In the military & defense sector, the most commonly used \\ntypes of biometric technologies are iris, fingerprint, and face recognition.  \\nSeveral rules and regulations concerning the use of access control systems are formulated by government \\nbodies to maintain the privacy of important data. According to these regulations, only a few authorized \\npersonnel can have access to security data and monitoring rooms. In addition, this data cannot be shared \\nthrough web services directly without gaining permission from the regulatory authorities. In the US, the \\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) provides a few standards for the protection of resources used in surveillance \\nsystems. Major players in the access control market providing access control solutions for the military & \\ndefense vertical are Honeywell International Inc.

This \\nfactor is propelling the fire protection system market in the US. \\n11.2.3 \\nCANADA \\nIn Canada, the market for electronic security equipment, such as sophisticated motion detectors, video \\ncameras, and automatic lighting controls, is expected to witness rapid growth in the next 4–5 years. \\nSecurity systems are distributed through short marketing channels in this region owing to the limited \\navailability of large distributors who control this market.  \\nThe adoption of access control systems is driven by the high demand for security in the industrial and \\ngovernment verticals as well as growing public awareness toward security. The commercial and industrial \\nverticals are the major end users in the Canadian market. The Canadian government has recommended \\nthe implementation of advanced security technologies in corporations, airports, hospitals, and other \\norganizations for enhanced safety, thereby driving the growth of the access control market in the country. \\nFurthermore, the growing economy of Canada has led to an increasing focus on securing assets in \\ncommercial and industrial areas. For instance, Dove Capital (Ontario, Canada) is a real estate firm that was \\nchallenged by the limitations of its legacy systems and required immediate access to its data to make \\nquick and informed decisions. The firm chose Honeywell Security Group’s (US) MAXPRO Cloud, a cloud-\\nbased service, to simplify the process of managing multiple sites and allow users to access all locations in \\na single view. Canada is home to a number of private military and security companies. Security screening \\nfor passengers and their belongings is mostly done at airports to ensure safety. The number of domestic \\nand international passengers is increasing rapidly due to the reduced prices of air transportation. Card- \\nand biometrics-based access control systems are widely used at airports for security purposes. All these \\nfactors are expected to boost the growth of the access control market in Canada. \\n \\n161 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\nIn Canada, a growing number of cities are installing CCTV cameras on open streets in which most of the \\ncameras are mounted on walls, street lamps, fences, and roofs. Major companies such as Hikvision, \\nDahua, and Arecont Vision have begun operations in Canada. Upgrading old systems or replacing analog \\nsystems with IP systems are the major driving factors in the video surveillance systems market in Canada. \\n11.2.4 \\nMEXICO \\nThe market for access control systems, among other security equipment, is growing at a high rate in \\nMexico because of the growing need to prevent attacks or security threats. Over the last few years, the \\nmajor security risk faced in Mexico is the high crime rate, which is further accelerated by the drug cartels in \\nthe country, which leads to an increased range of crimes in addition to drug offenses, affecting the general \\npublic and travelers. With increasing government focus on security, there is a growing demand to \\nauthenticate access to public and private places. Thus, public and private institutions in the country are \\ninstalling and integrating security systems, including access control systems, in the country.  \\nThe adoption rate of video surveillance security is also growing. The northern part of Mexico was \\nconsidered a higher threat area due to illegal engagements and drug trafficking. These crimes in Mexico \\nhave been now decreased due to the installation of video surveillance systems throughout the state to \\nallow officials to assess the situation and take appropriate decisions. Mexico is developing as a \\nmanufacturing hub for various industries, such as automobiles, electronics, and pharmaceuticals. \\nManufacturing industries in Mexico are investing heavily in improving their warehouse infrastructure. Thus, \\ncompanies are adopting fire protection systems to protect their warehouses from fire. Also, government \\nregulations in Mexico are supporting the adoption of fire protection systems. \\n11.3 \\nEUROPE \\n11.3.1 \\nGROWING NEED FOR ADVANCED SECURITY TO ENSURE PROTECTION \\nAGAINST TERRORIST ATTACKS \\nGermany, the UK, France, and Italy play a significant role in the European commercial security system \\nmarket and is expected to continue to do so in the coming years. The major security challenges in this \\nregion include the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflicts, organized crimes, and \\nterrorism. The European Union has devised strategies to counter such threats, and various companies are \\nalso taking initiatives to provide security solutions in the region. \\nThe growing need for advanced security to ensure protection against terrorist attacks has increased the \\nadoption of biometric technologies in Europe. The deployment of national IDs, e-passports, and e-visas is \\nexpected to be the main driver for the growth of the European biometric system market. The UK \\ngovernment has adopted biometric technologies in airports and ports to strengthen security systems. The \\nEU government is also supporting the deployment and R&D for biometric systems to be used in border \\ncontrol across the region. ABC4EU (Europe), or Automated Border Control Gates for Europe, is a project \\nsupported by 15 partners, including Indra Sistemas and Cognitec Systems, to standardize the working of \\nall the European automated border control (ABC) systems equipped with biometric technology. \\nIncreased terror attacks in recent times in the European region have led to the crucial value of video \\nsurveillance and video analytics, which gave security forces time-critical information, enabling them to \\nevade several such incidents. A large number of analog video surveillance systems are already being \\ninstalled in this region; therefore, replacing analog systems with IP systems and analog HD systems \\nprovides growth opportunities.  \\n \\n \\n \\n162 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS -

In the past few years, the \\nworld has witnessed several instances of terrorist attacks, aircraft hijacking, and other security threats. \\nThus, there is an increasing need for airport security and border control. The biometrics database of \\nGermany is among the most forgery-proof databases in the world. When it comes to electronic documents, \\nGermany is at the forefront of striving to achieve the best identity protection possible. Biometric recognition \\nsystems based on fingerprints, hand geometry, iris, and face verification, as well as signature verification \\nsystems, are used to screen passengers and their belongings at airports to prevent terrorism and \\nsmuggling.  \\nGermany had suffered 2 terrorist attacks in 2017 (one on a train and another at a music festival). \\nInstances of sexual assaults in 2015 New Year\\'s Eve also raised concerns about security on Germany’s \\nstreets. To overcome such security concerns, many German enterprises and businesses have started \\ndeploying different types of biometric access control systems. Biometrics is facilitating the building of new \\napplications, especially in the retail, banking, and healthcare sectors. Though fingerprint recognition is a \\nprominent technology in the biometric system market, other technologies such as facial recognition, iris \\nrecognition, and gait recognition are also expected to gain traction in the market. In November 2017, \\nGermany passed a law allowing the government to use facial recognition software for public safety. \\nThe German government is also proactive in implementing several laws for the development of video \\nsurveillance infrastructure. Some of these laws will relax restrictions on video surveillance across shops, \\nshopping centers, football stadiums, parking lots, and stations, while others will permit law enforcement \\nofficials and the police to wear body cams and to read the license plates on cars to facilitate searches for \\nwanted persons. For instance, the Federal Ministry of Germany has announced plans to install video \\nsurveillance technology, integrated with facial recognition capabilities, across major train stations by 2024. \\n \\n \\n \\n167 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n11.3.4 \\nFRANCE \\nFrance has large and diversified industrial and agricultural bases.

Government \\nefforts to fight terrorism are driving the market. The increase in government initiatives pertaining to smart \\nsecurity systems due to upcoming events such as the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar is expected to lead to \\nan increase in the demand for video surveillance systems. Video surveillance also plays an important role \\nin boosting people’s sense of security in situations of political unrest. In the Middle East, video surveillance \\nsystems have penetrated applications such as defense, infrastructure, commercial, and industrial. \\nIn the Middle Eastern region, fire protection systems are used in various verticals, such as oil, gas, and \\nmining and energy & power. As these industries are more developed in the Middle East than in South \\nAmerica, the fire protection system market is more developed in the Middle East than in South America. \\nThe increasing use of digital technology is expected to drive the growth of this market. The market would \\nbe driven by utilities and aerospace applications in the industrial vertical (with the growing adoption of \\nelectronic locks and multi-technology readers). The region holds significant opportunities for access control \\nproduct and service providers. Developing countries such as Brazil and Argentina are expected to drive the \\ngrowth of the access control market in South America in the near future. \\n \\n \\n \\n177 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n11.5.2 \\nMIDDLE EAST & AFRICA \\nThe Middle East is developing rapidly in terms of the adoption of advanced technologies. Oil & gas and \\nmedical are the major verticals in this region. Access control systems have a significant demand in Middle \\nEastern countries as governments focus on providing efficient security solutions. Rising security spending \\nby governments, the growing number of tourists, increasing number of government projects, the upcoming \\nWorld Expo 2020 in the UAE, and increasing spending on IT are some of the factors driving the demand for \\nsecurity equipment. The growth is primarily expected from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Israel. In \\nSaudi Arabia, biometric technology has been implemented for airport security and tourist monitoring. In \\nJune 2017, the Dubai-based Emirates airline launched the “Together” initiative in collaboration with Dubai \\nCustoms, Dubai General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA), Dubai Police, and Dubai \\nAirports. This initiative is likely to include the deployment of automated border control gates and biometric \\ntechnology to accelerate traveler processing time and increase operational efficiency. \\nThe growing public and private sector construction infrastructure projects and continued political and \\nsecurity threats are leading to increasing demand in the Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) \\nsurveillance system market. In Qatar, large infrastructure and leisure projects linked to the 2022 FIFA \\nWorld Cup, coupled with local regulations, are important factors for the growth of the video surveillance \\nsystem market. Government initiatives such as Saudi Vision 2030 and UAE Vision 2021 have come up with \\ndifferent ventures in infrastructural developments. These construction activities require fire safety \\nproducts, which is expected to result in the adoption of fire protection systems in the coming years. \\nThe African market mainly comprises South Africa, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola, and Sudan. The \\nsecurity solutions market in Africa is changing rapidly, with owners of retail and commercial properties, \\namong others, adopting different security technologies and solutions for increased safety. This is mainly \\ndue to the rise in crime rates as well as their violent nature. Real estate developers emphasize greatly on \\nthe reputation of the security company they sign contracts with. Hence, it is essential for companies to \\nkeep themselves abreast of the emerging trends as well as maintain consistent performance to obtain \\ncontracts in this region.  \\nThe African access control market is mainly driven by the increasing investments by transport authorities \\nand growth in government spending to strengthen border security. The governments of Congo, Rwanda, \\nand other African countries are actively registering their citizens’ biometric data. \\nThe African video surveillance market, which includes analog and IP systems, is still growing. Africa, \\nNigeria, and Kenya are expected to witness significant growth, and technological advancements have \\nbenefited the video surveillance market, which is expected to result in an increase in the installation of \\nvideo surveillance systems. \\n11.5.3 \\nSOUTH AMERICA \\nThe key states in Brazil—Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, and Espirito Santo—offer potential \\nopportunities for electronic security equipment, including CCTVs and alarm systems as well as access \\ncontrol equipment. \\nRest of South America includes Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia. The most common crimes occurring \\nin Argentina are theft, burglary, bag snatching, armed robberies, and kidnapping. Therefore, various \\ncompanies such as Johnson Controls (US), Honeywell International, Inc. (US), and Risco Group (Israel) are \\noperating in the country to provide a wide range of security products and solutions to customers. \\n \\n178 \\nCOMMERCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MARKET WITH COVID-19 IMPACT ANALYSIS - GLOBAL FORECAST TO 2026 \\nDECEMBER 2020 © MarketsandMarkets™ \\n12 \\nCOMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE \\n \\n12.1 \\nOVERVIEW \\nThis chapter describes the dynamics of the commercial security system market from the key players’ \\nperspectives.
